### Where can I view my billing date?

Navigate to the **Plan** tab in your billing settings. The billing date is located near the bottom-right.

### What credit and debit cards are supported?

- Visa
- MasterCard
- American Express
- Discover
- JCB
- Diners
- UnionPay

### What happens if my subscription payment fails?

If your subscription payment fails, there is a grace period of 15 days, including the due date. Docker retries to collect the payment 8 times using the following schedule:

- Next day after the due date (aka day 1 after the due date)
- Next day after the first retry (aka day 2 after the due date)
- Then every other day (aka day 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 after the due date)

Docker also sends an email notification `Action Required - Credit Card Payment Failed` with an attached unpaid invoice after each failed payment attempt. 

Once the grace period is over and the invoice is still not paid, the subscription is downgraded to a free plan and all paid features are disabled. 

## What billing-related emails will I receive from Docker Hub?

Docker Hub sends the following billing-related emails:

- Confirmation of a new subscription.
- Confirmation of paid invoices. 
- Notifications of credit or debit card payment failures. 
- Notifications of credit or debit card expiration. 
- Confirmation of a cancelled subscription 
- Reminders of subscription renewals for annual subscribers. This is sent 14 days before the renewal date.

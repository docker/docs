## What Docker Desktop versions are supported?

For Docker Business customers, we offer support for versions up to six months older than the latest version, although any fixes will be on the latest version.

For Pro and Team customers, we only offer support for the latest version of Docker Desktop. If you are running an older version, you may be asked to update before we investigate your support request.

## How many machines can I get support for Docker Desktop on?

As a Pro user you can get support for Docker Desktop on a single machine.
As a Team, you can get support for Docker Desktop for the number of machines equal to the number of seats as part of your plan.

## What OSâ€™s are supported?

Docker Desktop is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows. The supported version information can be found on the following pages:

* [Mac system requirements](../desktop/install/mac-install.md/#system-requirements)
* [Windows system requirements](../desktop/install/windows-install.md/#system-requirements)
* [Linux system requirements](../desktop/install/linux-install.md/#system-requirements)

## How is personal diagnostic data handled in Docker Desktop?

When uploading diagnostics to help Docker with investigating issues, the uploaded diagnostics bundle may contain personal data such as usernames and IP addresses. The diagnostics bundles are only accessible to Docker, Inc.
employees who are directly involved in diagnosing Docker Desktop issues.

By default, Docker, Inc. will delete uploaded diagnostics bundles after 30 days. You may also request the removal of a diagnostics bundle by either specifying the diagnostics ID or via your GitHub ID (if the diagnostics ID is mentioned in a GitHub issue). Docker, Inc. will only use the data in the diagnostics bundle to investigate specific user issues but may derive high-level (non personal) metrics such as the rate of issues from it.

For more information, see [Docker Data Processing Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/data-processing-agreement){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}.

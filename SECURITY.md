IMPORTANT NOTE: Most educators and professionals do not consider it appropriate to use tertiary sources such as encyclopedias as a sole source for any information—citing an encyclopedia as an important reference in footnotes or bibliographies may result in censure or a failing grade. Wikipedia articles should be used for background information, as a reference for correct terminology and search terms, and as a starting point for further research.
As with any community-built reference, there is a possibility for error in Wikipedia's content—please check your facts against multiple sources and read our disclaimers for more information.

@misc{ enwiki:1267164555,
    author = "{Wikipedia contributors}",
    title = "Second Level Address Translation --- {Wikipedia}{,} The Free Encyclopedia",
    year = "2025",

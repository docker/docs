## Install Compose

If you have Docker Desktop, you've got a full Docker installation, including Compose.

### New Docker Installation

The best way of getting Compose is by installing Docker Desktop.
 Get [Docker Desktop](../../desktop/#download-and-install) to get a full Docker installation and managed updates.

|:---------------|:------------------------------:|
|Linux (64-bit)  |{{ yes }} [Install](../../desktop/install/linux-install.md)|
|Mac             |{{ yes }} [Install](../../desktop/install/mac-install.md)|
|Windows         |{{ yes }} [Install](../../desktop/install/windows-install.md)|


### Pre-existing Docker Installation

If you have a Docker installation on Linux to which you want to add the Compose plugin, check [Install on Linux](./compose-linux.md).

On this page you can find information on how to get and install Compose.

## Install Compose

If you have Docker Desktop, you've got a full Docker installation, including Compose.

You can check this by clicking on **About Docker Desktop** from the Docker menu ![whale menu](../../desktop/images/whale-x.svg){: .inline}.

### New Docker Installation

If you havenâ€™t yet installed Docker Desktop:

{% assign yes = '![yes](/assets/images/green-check.svg){: .inline style="height: 14px; margin: 0 auto; align=right"}' %}

| Platform       | Docker Desktop                 |
|:---------------|:------------------------------:|
|Linux (64-bit)  |{{ yes }} [Install](../../desktop/install/linux-install.md)|
|Mac             |{{ yes }} [Install](../../desktop/install/mac-install.md)|
|Windows         |{{ yes }} [Install](../../desktop/install/windows-install.md)|


### Pre-existing Docker Installation

If you have a Docker installation on Linux to which you want to add the Compose plugin, you can choose one of these options:

* [Install using the repository](./linux.md#install-using-the-repository)
* [Install the plugin manually](./linux.md#install-the-plugin-manually)

### Other install scenarios

For other options, see [Other install scenarios](./other.md).

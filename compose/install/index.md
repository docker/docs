In this page you can find a summary of the available options for installing Compose. 

## Compose Prerequisites

* Docker Compose requires Docker Engine.
* Docker Compose plugin requires Docker CLI.

## Compose Installation Scenarios
You can run Compose on macOS, Windows, and 64-bit Linux. Check what installation scenario fits your needs. 

Are you looking to:

* __Get latest Compose and its prerequisites right of the bat__:
Install Docker Desktop for your platform. This is the fastest route and you get Docker Engine and Docker CLI with the Compose plugin.
Docker Desktop is available for Mac, Windows and Linux.

* __Install Compose plug in:__
  + __(Mac, Win, Linux) Docker Desktop__: If you have Desktop installed then you already have the Compose plugin installed.
  + __Windows Server__: If you want to run the Docker daemon and client directly on Microsoft Windows Server, follow the [Windows Server install instructions](compose-plugin#install-compose-on-windows-server)
  + __Linux systems__ - other methods of intallation: 
     + To install Docker Compose with the Docker Engine we recommend [setting up Docker's repository](compose-plugin#install-using-the-repository) or,
     + Using the [convenience scripts](../../../engine/install/#server){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"} offered per Linux distro from the Engine install section. 
    + Other scenarios, check the [Linux install](compose-plugin#installing-compose-on-linux-systems).

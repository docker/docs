The following samples show the various aspects of how to work with Docker
Compose. As a prerequisite, be sure to [install Docker Compose](install/index.md)
if you have not already done so.

## Key concepts these samples cover

The samples should help you to:

- define services based on Docker images using
  [Compose files](compose-file/index.md) `docker-compose.yml` and
  `docker-stack.yml` files
- understand the relationship between `docker-compose.yml` and
  [Dockerfiles](/engine/reference/builder/)
- learn how to make calls to your application services from Compose files
- learn how to deploy applications and services to a [swarm](../engine/swarm/index.md)

## Samples tailored to demo Compose

These samples focus specifically on Docker Compose:

- [Quickstart: Compose and Django](../samples/django.md) - Shows how to use Docker Compose to set up and run a simple Django/PostgreSQL app.

- [Quickstart: Compose and Rails](../samples/rails.md) - Shows how to use
Docker Compose to set up and run a Rails/PostgreSQL app.

- [Quickstart: Compose and WordPress](../samples/wordpress.md) - Shows how to
use Docker Compose to set up and run WordPress in an isolated environment
with Docker containers.

## Awesome Compose samples

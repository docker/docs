Pushes images for services to their respective `registry/repository`.

The following assumptions are made:

- You are pushing an image you have built locally

- You have access to the build key

## Example

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  service1:
    build: .
    image: localhost:5000/yourimage  # goes to local registry

  service2:
    build: .
    image: youruser/yourimage  # goes to youruser DockerHub registry
```

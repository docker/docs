You can use Docker Compose binary, `docker-compose [-f <arg>...] [options]
[COMMAND] [ARGS...]`, to build and manage multiple services in Docker containers.

## Use `-f` to specify name and path of one or more Compose files

Use the `-f` flag to specify the location of a Compose configuration file.

### Specifying multiple Compose files

You can supply multiple `-f` configuration files. When you supply multiple
files, Compose combines them into a single configuration. Compose builds the
configuration in the order you supply the files. Subsequent files override and
add to their predecessors.

For example, consider this command line:

```console
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.admin.yml run backup_db
```

The `docker-compose.yml` file might specify a `webapp` service.

```yaml
webapp:
  image: examples/web
  ports:
    - "8000:8000"
  volumes:
    - "/data"
```

If the `docker-compose.admin.yml` also specifies this same service, any matching
fields override the previous file. New values, add to the `webapp` service
configuration.

```yaml
webapp:
  build: .
  environment:
    - DEBUG=1
```

When you use multiple Compose files, all paths in the files are relative to the
first configuration file specified with `-f`. You can use the
`--project-directory` option to override this base path.

Use a `-f` with `-` (dash) as the filename to read the configuration from
`stdin`. When `stdin` is used all paths in the configuration are
relative to the current working directory.

The `-f` flag is optional. If you don't provide this flag on the command line,
Compose traverses the working directory and its parent directories looking for a
`docker-compose.yml` and a `docker-compose.override.yml` file. You must supply
at least the `docker-compose.yml` file. If both files are present on the same
directory level, Compose combines the two files into a single configuration.

The configuration in the `docker-compose.override.yml` file is applied over and
in addition to the values in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Specifying a path to a single Compose file

You can use the `-f` flag to specify a path to a Compose file that is not
located in the current directory, either from the command line or by setting up
a [COMPOSE_FILE environment variable](envvars.md#compose_file) in your shell or
in an environment file.

For an example of using the `-f` option at the command line, suppose you are
running the [Compose Rails sample](../../samples/rails.md), and
have a `docker-compose.yml` file in a directory called `sandbox/rails`. You can
use a command like [docker-compose pull](pull.md) to get the
postgres image for the `db` service from anywhere by using the `-f` flag as
follows: `docker-compose -f ~/sandbox/rails/docker-compose.yml pull db`

Here's the full example:

```console
$ docker-compose -f ~/sandbox/rails/docker-compose.yml pull db
Pulling db (postgres:latest)...
latest: Pulling from library/postgres

Status: Downloaded newer image for postgres:latest
```

## Use `-p` to specify a project name

Each configuration has a project name. If you supply a `-p` flag, you can
specify a project name. If you don't specify the flag, Compose uses the current
directory name. See also the [COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME environment variable](envvars.md#compose_project_name).

## Use `--profile` to specify one or more active profiles

Calling `docker-compose --profile frontend up` will start the services with the
profile `frontend` and services without specified profiles. You can also enable
multiple profiles, e.g. with `docker-compose --profile frontend --profile debug up`
the profiles `frontend` and `debug` will be enabled.

See also [_Using profiles with Compose_](../profiles.md) and the
[`COMPOSE_PROFILES` environment variable](envvars.md#compose_profiles).

## Set up environment variables

You can set [environment variables](envvars.md) for various
`docker-compose` options, including the `-f` and `-p` flags.

For example, the [COMPOSE_FILE environment variable](envvars.md#compose_file)
relates to the `-f` flag, and `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`
[environment variable](envvars.md#compose_project_name) relates to the `-p` flag.

Also, you can set some of these variables in an [environment file](../env-file.md).

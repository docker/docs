Generate a Distributed Application Bundle (DAB) from the Compose file.

Images must have digests stored, which requires interaction with a
Docker registry. If digests aren't stored for all images, you can fetch
them with `docker-compose pull` or `docker-compose push`. To push images
automatically when bundling, pass `--push-images`. Only services with
a `build` option specified have their images pushed.

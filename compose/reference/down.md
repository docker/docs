```none
Usage: docker-compose down [options]

Options:
    --rmi type              Remove images. Type must be one of:
                              'all': Remove all images used by any service.
                              'local': Remove only images that don't have a
                              custom tag set by the `image` field.
    -v, --volumes           Remove named volumes declared in the `volumes`
                            section of the Compose file and anonymous volumes
                            attached to containers.
    --remove-orphans        Remove containers for services not defined in the
                            Compose file
    -t, --timeout TIMEOUT   Specify a shutdown timeout in seconds.
                            (default: 10)
```

Stops containers and removes containers, networks, volumes, and images
created by `up`.

By default, the only things removed are:

- Containers for services defined in the Compose file
- Networks defined in the `networks` section of the Compose file
- The default network, if one is used

Networks and volumes defined as `external` are never removed.

Anonymous volumes are not removed by default. However, as they don't 
have a stable name, they will not be automatically mounted by a subsequent
`up`. For data that needs to persist between updates, use host or
named volumes.

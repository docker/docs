```none
Usage: docker-compose exec [options] [-e KEY=VAL...] SERVICE COMMAND [ARGS...]

Options:
    -d, --detach      Detached mode: Run command in the background.
    --privileged      Give extended privileges to the process.
    -u, --user USER   Run the command as this user.
    -T                Disable pseudo-tty allocation. By default `docker-compose exec`
                      allocates a TTY.
    --index=index     index of the container if there are multiple
                      instances of a service [default: 1]
    -e, --env KEY=VAL Set environment variables (can be used multiple times,
                      not supported in API < 1.25)
    -w, --workdir DIR Path to workdir directory for this command.
```

This is the equivalent of `docker exec`. With this subcommand you can run arbitrary
commands in your services. Commands are by default allocating a TTY, so you can
use a command such as `docker-compose exec web sh` to get an interactive prompt.

## Reference and guidelines

These topics describe the Docker Compose implementation of the Compose format.
Docker Compose **1.27.0+** implements the format defined by the [Compose Specification](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md). Previous Docker Compose versions have support for several Compose file formats â€“ 2, 2.x, and 3.x. The Compose specification is a unified 2.x and 3.x file format, aggregating properties across these formats.

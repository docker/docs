On August 31, 2021, we [announced](https://www.docker.com/blog/updating-product-subscriptions/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_" id="dkr_docs_subscription_btl"} updates and extensions to our product subscriptions to increase productivity, collaboration, and added security for our developers and businesses. Docker subscription tiers now include Personal, Pro, Team, and Business.

### Summary of the changes

- We’re introducing a **new** product subscription, Docker Business, for organizations using Docker at scale for application development and require features like secure software supply chain management, single sign-on (SSO), container registry access controls, and more.

- Our [Docker Subscription Service Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-subscription-service-agreement){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_" id="dkr_docs_subscription_btl"} includes a change to the terms for **Docker Desktop**.
    - Docker Desktop **remains free** for small businesses (fewer than 250 employees AND less than $10 million in annual revenue), personal use, education, and non-commercial open-source projects.
    - It requires a paid subscription (**Pro, Team, or Business**), for as little as $5 a month, for commercial use in larger enterprises.
- The Docker Pro and Docker Team subscriptions now **include commercial use** of Docker Desktop.
- The existing Docker Free subscription has been renamed **Docker Personal**.
- **No changes** to Docker Engine or any other upstream **open-source** Docker or Moby project.

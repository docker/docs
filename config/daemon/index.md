title: Docker daemon configuration overview
---

This page shows you how to customize the Docker daemon, `dockerd`.

## Configure the Docker daemon

There are two ways to configure the Docker daemon:

- Use a JSON configuration file. This is the preferred option, since it keeps
  all configurations in a single place.
- Use flags when starting `dockerd`.

You can use both of these options together as long as you don't specify the same
option both as a flag and in the JSON file. If that happens, the Docker daemon
won't start and prints an error message.

To configure the Docker daemon using a JSON file, create a file at
`/etc/docker/daemon.json` on Linux systems, or
`C:\ProgramData\docker\config\daemon.json` on Windows.

Here's what the configuration file might look like:

```json
{
  "builder": {
    "gc": {
      "defaultKeepStorage": "20GB",
      "enabled": true
    }
  },
  "experimental": false,
  "features": {
    "buildkit": true
  }
}
```

In addition to Docker Desktop default values, this configuration enables garbage
collection at a 20GB threshold, and enables buildkit.

Using this configuration file, run the Docker daemon in debug mode, using TLS, and
listen for traffic routed to `192.168.59.3` on port `2376`. You can learn what
configuration options are available in the
[dockerd reference docs](../../engine/reference/commandline/dockerd.md#daemon-configuration-file)

You can also start the Docker daemon manually and configure it using flags. This
can be useful for troubleshooting problems.

Here's an example of how to manually start the Docker daemon, using the same
configurations as shown in the previous JSON configuration:

```console
$ dockerd --debug \
  --tls=true \
  --tlscert=/var/docker/server.pem \
  --tlskey=/var/docker/serverkey.pem \
  --host tcp://192.168.59.3:2376
```

You can learn what configuration options are available in the
[dockerd reference docs](../../engine/reference/commandline/dockerd.md), or by
running:

```console
$ dockerd --help
```

Many specific configuration options are discussed throughout the Docker
documentation. Some places to go next include:

- [Automatically start containers](../containers/start-containers-automatically.md)
- [Limit a container's resources](../containers/resource_constraints.md)
- [Configure storage drivers](../../storage/storagedriver/select-storage-driver.md)
- [Container security](../../engine/security/index.md)

You can configure most daemon options using the `daemon.json` file. One thing
you can't configure using daemon.json mechanism is an HTTP proxy. For
instructions on using a proxy, see
[Configure Docker to use a proxy server](../../network/proxy.md).

## Daemon data directory

The Docker daemon persists all data in a single directory. This tracks
everything related to Docker, including containers, images, volumes, service
definition, and secrets.

By default this directory is:

- `/var/lib/docker` on Linux.
- `C:\ProgramData\docker` on Windows.

You can configure the Docker daemon to use a different directory, using the
`data-root` configuration option. For example:

```json
{
  "data-root": "/mnt/docker-data"
}
```

Since the state of a Docker daemon is kept on this directory, make sure you use
a dedicated directory for each daemon. If two daemons share the same directory,
for example, an NFS share, you are going to experience errors that are difficult
to troubleshoot.

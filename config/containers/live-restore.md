By default, when the Docker daemon terminates, it shuts down running containers.
Starting with Docker Engine 1.12, you can configure the daemon so that
containers remain running if the daemon becomes unavailable. This functionality
is called _live restore_. The live restore option helps reduce container
downtime due to daemon crashes, planned outages, or upgrades.

> **Note**: Live restore is not supported on Windows containers, but it does work
for Linux containers running on Docker for Windows.

## Enable live restore

There are two ways to enable the live restore setting to keep containers alive
when the daemon becomes unavailable. **Only do one of the following**.

* Add the configuration to the daemon configuration file. On Linux, this
  defaults to `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. On Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows,
  select the Docker icon from the task bar, then click
  **Preferences** -> **Daemon** -> **Advanced**.

  - Use the following JSON to enable `live-restore`.

    ```json
    {
      "live-restore": true
    }
    ```

  - Restart the Docker daemon. On Linux, you can avoid a restart (and avoid any
    downtime for your containers) by reload the Docker daemon. If you use
    `systemd`, then use the command `systemctl reload docker`. Otherwise, send a
    `SIGHUP` signal to the `dockerd` process.

* If you prefer, you can start the `dockerd` process manually with the
  `--live-restore` flag. This approach is not recommended because it does not
  set up the environment that `systemd` or another process manager would use
  when starting the Docker process. This can cause unexpected behavior.


## Live restore during upgrades

The live restore feature supports restoring containers to the daemon for
upgrades from one minor release to the next, such as when upgrading from Docker
1.12.1 to 1.12.2.

If you skip releases during an upgrade, the daemon may not restore its
connection to the containers. If the daemon can't restore the connection, it
cannot manage the running containers and you must stop them manually.

## Live restore upon restart

The live restore option only works to restore containers if the daemon options,
such as bridge IP addresses and graph driver, did not change. If any of these
daemon-level configuration options have changed, the live restore may not work
and you may need to manually stop the containers.

## Impact of live restore on running containers

If the daemon is down for a long time, running containers may fill up the FIFO
log the daemon normally reads. A full log blocks containers from logging more
data. The default buffer size is 64K. If the buffers fill, you must restart
the Docker daemon to flush them.

On Linux, you can modify the kernel's buffer size by changing
`/proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size`. You cannot modify the buffer size on Docker for
Mac or Docker for Windows.

## Live restore and swarm mode

The live restore option only pertains to standalone containers, and not to swarm
services. Swarm services are managed by swarm managers. If swarm managers are
not available, swarm services continue to run on worker nodes but cannot be
managed until enough swarm managers are available to maintain a quorum.

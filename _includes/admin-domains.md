1. Sign in to {{ product_link }}{: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}.
2. {{ domain_navigation }}
3. Select **Add a domain**.
4. Continue with the on-screen instructions to get the **TXT Record Value**. Copy this value to paste into a TXT record that you create in your Domain Name System (DNS) settings.

    >**Note**
    >
    > Format your domains without protocol or www information, for example, `yourcompany.example`. This should include all email domains and subdomains users will use to access Docker, for example `yourcompany.example` and `us.yourcompany.example`. Public domains such as `gmail.com`, `outlook.com`, etc. arenâ€™t permitted. Also, the email domain should be set as the primary email.

5. Add a TXT record to your DNS settings. The steps to do so may vary depending on your DNS provider.

   >**Note**
   >
   > When you add the TXT record, ensure that you create the record on the root of the zone. This is typically denoted with the `@` name for the record.

6. Use the TXT Record Value that you copied in the prior step and add this into the corresponding field of the record you create.
7. Once you have waited 72 hours for the TXT record verification, you can then select **Verify** next to the domain you've added, and follow the on-screen instructions.

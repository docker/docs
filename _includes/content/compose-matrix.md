In addition to Compose file format versions shown in the table, the Compose
itself is on a release schedule, as shown in [Compose
releases](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/), but file format versions
do not necessairly increment with each release. For example, Compose file format
3.0 was first introduced in [Compose release
1.10.0](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.10.0), and versioned
gradually in subsequent releases.

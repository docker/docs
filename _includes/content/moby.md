Docker [introduced the open source Moby
project](https://blog.docker.com/2017/04/introducing-the-moby-project/) to
further promote collaboration, experimentation, and development of
container-based systems in the broader community. Moby is a library of
containerized components, a framework for assembling components into a container
platform, and tools to build, test, and deploy artifacts. It included a
reference assembly, which is the open base for the Docker platform.

You can read about the Moby project, the open framework, components, and
relationship of Docker to Moby at [mobyproject.org](https://mobyproject.org/).

The Moby project lives [here](https://github.com/moby/moby).

See [Contribute to the Moby project](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to learn how to help work on the codebase.

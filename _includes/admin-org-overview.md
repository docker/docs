An organization in Docker is a collection of teams and repositories
that can be managed together. A team is a group of Docker members that belong to an organization.
An organization can have multiple teams.

Docker users become members of an organization
when they are assigned to at least one team in the organization. When you first
create an organization, you have one team, the "owners" team, that has a single member. An organization owner is someone that is part of the
owners team. They can create new teams and add
members to an existing team using their Docker ID or email address and by
selecting a team the user should be part of. An organization owner can also add
additional owners to help them manage users, teams, and repositories in the
organization.

The following diagram depicts the setup of an organization and how it relates to teams.

### Deleting SSO

When you disable SSO, you can delete the connection to remove the configuration settings and the added domains. Once you delete this connection, it can't be undone. Users must authenticate with their Docker ID and password or create a password reset if they don't have one.

## Manage users

> **Important**
>
> SSO has Just-In-Time (JIT) Provisioning enabled by default. This means your users are auto-provisioned to your organization.
>
> You can change this on a per-app basis. To prevent auto-provisioning users, you can create a security group in your IdP and configure the SSO app to authenticate and authorize only those users that are in the security group. Follow the instructions provided by your IdP:
>
> - [Okta](https://help.okta.com/en-us/Content/Topics/Security/policies/configure-app-signon-policies.htm)
> - [Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-restrict-your-app-to-a-set-of-users)

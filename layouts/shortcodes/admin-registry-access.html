{{ $product_link := "[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com)" }}
{{ $ram_navigation := "Select **My Hub**, your organization, **Settings**, and then select **Registry Access**." }}

To configure Registry Access Management permissions, perform the following steps:

1. Sign in to {{ $product_link }}.
2. {{ $ram_navigation }}
3. Enable Registry Access Management to set the permissions for your registry.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > When enabled, the Docker Hub registry is set by default; however you can
   > also restrict this registry for your developers.

4. Select **Add registry** and enter your registry details in the applicable
fields, and then select **Create** to add the registry to your list. You can
add up to 100 registries/domains.
5. Verify that the registry appears in your list and select **Save changes**.

Once you add a registry, it can take up to 24 hours for the changes to be
enforced on your developers’ machines.

If you want to apply the changes sooner, you must force a Docker signout on your
developers’ machine and have the developers re-authenticate for Docker Desktop.
See the [Caveats](#caveats) section below to learn more about limitations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Starting with Docker Desktop version 4.36, you can enforce sign-in for
multiple organizations. If a developer belongs to multiple organizations with
different RAM policies, only the RAM policy for the first organization listed
in the `registry.json` file, `.plist` file, or registry key is enforced.

> [!TIP]
>
> Since RAM sets policies about where content can be fetched from, the
[ADD](/reference/dockerfile/#add) instruction of the Dockerfile when the
parameter of the ADD instruction is a URL is also subject to registry
restrictions.
>
> If you're using ADD to fetch an image or artifact from a trusted registry via
> URL, make sure the registry's domain is included in your organzation's
> allowed registries list.
>
> RAM is not intended to restrict access to general-purpose external URLs, for
> example, package mirrors or storage services. Attempting to add too many domains
> may cause errors or hit system limits.

## Invite members

Owners can invite new members to an organization via Docker ID, email address, or via a CSV file containing email
addresses. If an invitee does not have a Docker account, they must create an account and verify their email address
before they can accept the invitation to join the organization. When inviting members, their pending invitation occupies
a seat.

### Invite members via Docker ID or email address

Use the following steps to invite members to your organization via Docker ID or email address. To invite a large amount
of members to your organization via CSV file, see the next section.

1. Sign in to {{ $product_link }}.
2. {{ $member_navigation }}
3. Select {{ $invite_button }}.
4. Select **Emails or usernames**.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to invite members.
   Invite a maximum of 1000 members and separate multiple entries by comma, semicolon, or space.

   > **Note**
   >
   > When you invite members, you assign them a role.
   > See [Roles and permissions](/security/for-admins/roles-and-permissions/)
   > for details about the access permissions for each role.

   Pending invitations appear in the table. The invitees receive an email with a link to Docker Hub where they can accept
   or decline the invitation.

### Invite members via CSV file

To invite multiple members to an organization via a CSV file containing email addresses:

1. Sign in to {{ $product_link }}.
2. {{ $member_navigation }}
3. Select {{ $invite_button }}.
4. Select **CSV upload**.
5. Select **Download the template CSV file** to optionally download an example CSV file.
   The following is an example of the contents of a valid CSV file.

   ```text
   email
   docker.user-0@example.com
   docker.user-1@example.com
   ```

   CSV file requirements:

   - The file must contain a header row with at least one heading named `email`. Additional columns are allowed and are
   ignored in the import.
   - The file must contain a maximum of 1000 email addresses (rows). To invite more than 1000 users, create multiple CSV
   files and perform all steps in this task for each file.

6. Create a new CSV file or export a CSV file from another application.

   - To export a CSV file from another application, see the applicationâ€™s documentation.
   - To create a new CSV file, open a new file in a text editor, type `email` on the first line, type the user email
     addresses one per line on the following lines, and then save the file with a .csv extension.

7. Select **Browse files** and then select your CSV file, or drag and drop the CSV file into the **Select a CSV file to
   upload** box. You can only select one CSV file at a time.

   > **Note**
   >
   > If the amount of email addresses in your CSV file exceeds the number of available seats in your organization, you
   > cannot continue to invite members. To invite members, you can purchase more seats, or remove some email addresses from
   > the CSV file and re-select the new file. To purchase more seats, see [Add seats to your
   > subscription](/subscription/add-seats/) or [Contact sales](https://www.docker.com/pricing/contact-sales/).

8. After the CSV file has been uploaded, select **Review**.

   Valid email addresses and any email addresses that have issues appear.
   Email addresses may have the following issues:

   - **Invalid email**: The email address is not a valid address.
     The email address will be ignored if you send invites.
     You can correct the email address in the CSV file and re-import the file.
   - **Already invited**: The user has already been sent an invite email and another invite email will not be sent.
   - **Member**: The user is already a member of your organization and an invite email will not be sent.
   - **Duplicate**: The CSV file has multiple occurrences of the same email address.
     The user will be sent only one invite email.

9. Follow the on-screen instructions to invite members.

   > **Note**
   >
   > When you invite members, you assign them a role.
   > See [Roles and permissions](/security/for-admins/roles-and-permissions/)
   > for details about the access permissions for each role.

Pending invitations appear in the table. The invitees receive an email with a link to Docker Hub where they can accept
or decline the invitation.

## Resend invitations

To resend an invitation if the invite is pending or declined:

1. Sign in to {{ $product_link }}.
2. {{ $member_navigation }}
3. In the table, locate the invitee, select the **Action** icon, and then select **Resend invitation**.
4. Select **Invite** to confirm.

## Remove a member or invitee

To remove a member from an organization:

1. Sign in to {{ $product_link }}.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to remove the member or invitee.

## Update a member role

Organization owners can manage [roles](/security/for-admins/roles-and-permissions/)
within an organization. If an organization is part of a company,
the company owner can also manage that organization's roles. If you have SSO enabled, you can use {{ $role_mapping_link }}.

> **Note**
>
> If you're the only owner of an organization,
> you need to assign a new owner before you can edit your role.

To update a member role:

1. Sign in to {{ $product_link }}.
2. {{ $member_navigation }}
3. Find the username of the member whose role you want to edit. In the table, select the **Actions** icon.

## Export members

Owners can export a CSV file containing all members.

1. Sign in to {{ $product_link }}.
2. {{ $domain_navigation }}
3. Select **Add a domain**.
4. Continue with the on-screen instructions to get a verification code for
   your domain as a **TXT Record Value**.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > Format your domains without protocol or www information, for example,
   > `yourcompany.example`. This should include all email domains and
   > subdomains users will use to access Docker, for example
   > `yourcompany.example` and `us.yourcompany.example`. Public domains such as
   > `gmail.com`, `outlook.com`, etc. aren’t permitted.

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > Make sure that the TXT record name that you create on your DNS matches
   > the domain you registered on Docker in Step 4. For example,
   > if you registered the subdomain `us.yourcompany.example`,
   > you need to create a TXT record within the same name/zone `us`.
   > A root domain such as `yourcompany.example` needs a TXT record on the
   > root zone, which is typically denoted with the `@` name for the record.

5. Once you have waited 72 hours for the TXT record verification,
   you can then select **Verify** next to the domain you've added,
   and follow the on-screen instructions.

To audit your domains:

1. Sign in to {{ $product_link }}.
2. {{ $domain_navigation }}
3. In **Domain Audit**, select **Export Users** to export a CSV file of uncaptured users with the following columns:

   - Name: The name of the user.
   - Username: The Docker ID of the user.
   - Email: The email address of the user.

You can invite all the uncaptured users to your organization using the exported CSV file. For more details, see [Invite members](/admin/organization/members/). Optionally, enforce single sign-on or enable SCIM to add users to your organization automatically. For more details, see {{ $sso_link }} or {{ $scim_link }}.

> **Note**
>
> Domain audit may identify accounts of users who are no longer a part of your organization. If you don't want to add a user to your organization and you don't want the user to appear in future domain audits, you must deactivate the account or update the associated email address.
>
> Only someone with access to the Docker account can deactivate the account or update the associated email address. For more details, see [Deactivating an account](/admin/deactivate-account/).

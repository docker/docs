> You can change this on a per-app basis. To prevent auto-provisioning users, you can create a security group in your IdP and configure the SSO app to authenticate and authorize only those users that are in the security group. Follow the instructions provided by your IdP:

### Manage how users are provisioned

> **Beta feature**
>
> Optional Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning is available in Private Beta when you use the Admin Console. If you're participating in this program, you have the option to turn off this default provisioning and disable JIT. This configuration is recommended if you're using SCIM to auto-provision users. See [SSO authentication with JIT provisioning disabled](/security/for-admins/group-mapping/#sso-authentication-with-jit-provisioning-disabled).

    ### Remove a network

    To remove the network named 'my-network':

    ```console
    $ docker network rm my-network
    ```

    ### Remove multiple networks

    To delete multiple networks in a single `docker network rm` command, provide
    multiple network names or ids. The following example deletes a network with id
    `3695c422697f` and a network named `my-network`:

    ```console
    $ docker network rm 3695c422697f my-network
    ```

    When you specify multiple networks, the command attempts to delete each in turn.
    If the deletion of one network fails, the command continues to the next on the
    list and tries to delete that. The command reports success or failure for each
    deletion.

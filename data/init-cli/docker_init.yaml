command: docker init
short: Creates Docker-related starter files for your project
long: |-
  Initialize a project with the files necessary to run the project in a container.

  Docker Desktop provides the `docker init` CLI command. Run `docker init` in your project directory to be walked through the creation of the following files with sensible defaults for your project:
    
    * .dockerignore
    * Dockerfile
    * compose.yaml
    * README.Docker.md
    
    If any of the files already exist, a prompt appears and provides a warning
    as well as giving you the option to overwrite all the files. If
    `docker-compose.yaml` already exists instead of `compose.yaml`, `docker
    init` can overwrite it, using `docker-compose.yaml` as the name for the
    Compose file.
    
    > **Warning**
    >
    > You can't recover overwritten files.
    > To back up an existing file before selecting to overwrite it, rename the file or copy it to another directory.
    { .warning }
  
  After running `docker init`, you can choose one of the following templates:
    
    * ASP.NET Core: Suitable for an ASP.NET Core application.
    * Go: Suitable for a Go server application.
    * Java: suitable for a Java application that uses Maven and packages as an uber jar.
    * Node: Suitable for a Node server application.
    * PHP with Apache: Suitable for a PHP web application.
    * Python: Suitable for a Python server application.
    * Rust: Suitable for a Rust server application.
    * Other: General purpose starting point for containerizing your application.
  
  After `docker init` has completed, you may need to modify the created files and tailor them to your project. Visit the following topics to learn more about the files:
    
    * [.dockerignore](../../../reference/dockerfile.md#dockerignore-file)
    * [Dockerfile](../../../reference/dockerfile.md)
    * [compose.yaml](../../../compose/compose-application-model.md)

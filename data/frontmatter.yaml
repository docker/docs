# this file lets you add descriptions and keywords
# to files without modifying the file.
#
# Useful for upstream pages where we don't want to
# or can't add front matter to the source!
#
# To add descriptions and keywords for a page,
# add a key with the path of the page file,
# relative to the content directory. For upstream
# page files, that's the target of the file mount.

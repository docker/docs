Ideally, very little data is written to a container's writable layer, and you
use Docker volumes to write data. However, some workloads require you to be able
to write to the container's writable layer. This is where storage drivers come
in.

Docker supports several different storage drivers, using a pluggable
architecture. The storage driver controls how images and containers are stored
and managed on your Docker host.

After you have read the [storage driver overview](index.md), the
next step is to choose the best storage driver for your workloads. In making
this decision, there are three high-level factors to consider:

If multiple storage drivers are supported in your kernel, Docker has a prioritized 
list of which storage driver to use if no storage driver is explicitly configured, 
assuming that the storage driver meets the prerequisites.

Use the storage driver with the best overall performance and stability in the most 
usual scenarios.
  
Docker supports the following storage drivers:

* `overlay2` is the preferred storage driver, for all currently supported
   Linux distributions, and requires no extra configuration.
* `aufs` was the preferred storage driver for Docker 18.06 and older, when
   running on Ubuntu 14.04 on kernel 3.13 which had no support for `overlay2`.
*  `fuse-overlayfs` is preferred only for running Rootless Docker
   on a host that does not provide support for rootless `overlay2`.
   On Ubuntu and Debian 10, the `fuse-overlayfs` driver does not need to be
   used `overlay2` works even in rootless mode.
   See [Rootless mode documentation](../../engine/security/rootless.md).
* `devicemapper` is supported, but requires `direct-lvm` for production
   environments, because `loopback-lvm`, while zero-configuration, has very
   poor performance. `devicemapper` was the recommended storage driver for
   CentOS and RHEL, as their kernel version did not support `overlay2`. However,
   current versions of CentOS and RHEL now have support for `overlay2`,
   which is now the recommended driver.
 * The `btrfs` and `zfs` storage drivers are used if they are the backing
   filesystem (the filesystem of the host on which Docker is installed).
   These filesystems allow for advanced options, such as creating "snapshots",
   but require more maintenance and setup. Each of these relies on the backing
   filesystem being configured correctly.
 * The `vfs` storage driver is intended for testing purposes, and for situations
   where no copy-on-write filesystem can be used. Performance of this storage
   driver is poor, and is not generally recommended for production use.

Docker's source code defines the selection order. You can see the order at
[the source code for Docker Engine {{ site.docker_ce_version }}](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/{{ site.docker_ce_version }}/daemon/graphdriver/driver_linux.go#L52-L53)

If you run a different version of Docker, you can use the branch selector at the top of the file viewer to choose a different branch.
{: id="storage-driver-order" }

Some storage drivers require you to use a specific format for the backing filesystem. If you have external 
requirements to use a specific backing filesystem, this may limit your choices. See [Supported backing filesystems](#supported-backing-filesystems).

After you have narrowed down which storage drivers you can choose from, your choice is determined by the 
characteristics of your workload and the level of stability you need. See [Other considerations](#other-considerations)
for help in making the final decision.

> ***NOTE***: Your choice may be limited by your operating system and distribution. 
> For instance, `aufs` is only supported on Ubuntu and Debian, and may require extra packages 
> to be installed, while `btrfs` is only supported on SLES, which is only supported with Docker
> Enterprise. See [Support storage drivers per Linux distribution](#supported-storage-drivers-per-linux-distribution) 
> for more information.


## Supported storage drivers per Linux distribution

At a high level, the storage drivers you can use is partially determined by
the Docker edition you use.

In addition, Docker does not recommend any configuration that requires you to
disable security features of your operating system, such as the need to disable
`selinux` if you use the `overlay` or `overlay2` driver on CentOS.

### Docker Engine - Community

For Docker Engine - Community, only some configurations are tested, and your operating
system's kernel may not support every storage driver. In general, the following
configurations work on recent versions of the Linux distribution:

| Linux distribution  | Recommended storage drivers                                            | Alternative drivers                               |
|:--------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| Docker Engine - Community on Ubuntu | `overlay2` or `aufs` (for Ubuntu 14.04 running on kernel 3.13)         | `overlay`¹, `devicemapper`², `zfs`, `vfs`         |
| Docker Engine - Community on Debian | `overlay2` (Debian Stretch), `aufs` or `devicemapper` (older versions) | `overlay`¹, `vfs`                                 |
| Docker Engine - Community on CentOS | `overlay2`                                                             | `overlay`¹, `devicemapper`², `zfs`, `vfs`         |
| Docker Engine - Community on Fedora | `overlay2`                                                             | `overlay`¹, `devicemapper`², `zfs`, `vfs`         |
| Docker Engine - Community on SLES 15 | `overlay2`                                                             | `overlay`¹, `devicemapper`², `vfs`                |
| Docker Engine - Community on RHEL | `overlay2`                                                             | `overlay`¹, `devicemapper`², `vfs`                |

¹) The `overlay` storage driver is deprecated, and will be removed in a future
release. It is recommended that users of the `overlay` storage driver migrate to `overlay2`.

²) The `devicemapper` storage driver is deprecated, and will be removed in a future
release. It is recommended that users of the `devicemapper` storage driver migrate
to `overlay2`.

> **Note**
>
> The comparison table above is not applicable for Rootless mode.
> For the drivers available in Rootless mode, see [the Rootless mode documentation](../../engine/security/rootless.md).

When possible, `overlay2` is the recommended storage driver. When installing
Docker for the first time, `overlay2` is used by default. Previously, `aufs` was
used by default when available, but this is no longer the case. If you want to
use `aufs` on new installations going forward, you need to explicitly configure
it, and you may need to install extra packages, such as `linux-image-extra`.
See [aufs](aufs-driver.md).

On existing installations using `aufs`, it is still used.

When in doubt, the best all-around configuration is to use a modern Linux
distribution with a kernel that supports the `overlay2` storage driver, and to
use Docker volumes for write-heavy workloads instead of relying on writing data
to the container's writable layer.

The `vfs` storage driver is usually not the best choice. Before using the `vfs`
storage driver, be sure to read about
[its performance and storage characteristics and limitations](vfs-driver.md).

### Docker Desktop for Mac and Docker Desktop for Windows

Docker Desktop for Mac and Docker Desktop for Windows are intended for development, rather
than production. Modifying the storage driver on these platforms is not
possible.

## Supported backing filesystems

With regard to Docker, the backing filesystem is the filesystem where
`/var/lib/docker/` is located. Some storage drivers only work with specific
backing filesystems.

| Storage driver        | Supported backing filesystems  |
|:----------------------|:------------------------------|
| `overlay2`, `overlay` | `xfs` with ftype=1, `ext4`    |
| `fuse-overlayfs`      | any filesystem                |
| `aufs`                | `xfs`, `ext4`                 |
| `devicemapper`        | `direct-lvm`                  |
| `btrfs`               | `btrfs`                       |
| `zfs`                 | `zfs`                         |
| `vfs`                 | any filesystem                 |

## Other considerations

### Suitability for your workload

Among other things, each storage driver has its own performance characteristics
that make it more or less suitable for different workloads. Consider the
following generalizations:

- `overlay2`, `aufs`, and `overlay` all operate at the file level rather than
  the block level. This uses memory more efficiently, but the container's
  writable layer may grow quite large in write-heavy workloads.
- Block-level storage drivers such as `devicemapper`, `btrfs`, and `zfs` perform
  better for write-heavy workloads (though not as well as Docker volumes).
- For lots of small writes or containers with many layers or deep filesystems,
  `overlay` may perform better than `overlay2`, but consumes more inodes, which
  can lead to inode exhaustion.
- `btrfs` and `zfs` require a lot of memory.
- `zfs` is a good choice for high-density workloads such as PaaS.

More information about performance, suitability, and best practices is available
in the documentation for each storage driver.

### Shared storage systems and the storage driver

If your enterprise uses SAN, NAS, hardware RAID, or other shared storage
systems, they may provide high availability, increased performance, thin
provisioning, deduplication, and compression. In many cases, Docker can work on
top of these storage systems, but Docker does not closely integrate with them.

Each Docker storage driver is based on a Linux filesystem or volume manager. Be
sure to follow existing best practices for operating your storage driver
(filesystem or volume manager) on top of your shared storage system. For
example, if using the ZFS storage driver on top of a shared storage system, be
sure to follow best practices for operating ZFS filesystems on top of that
specific shared storage system.

### Stability

For some users, stability is more important than performance. Though Docker
considers all of the storage drivers mentioned here to be stable, some are newer
and are still under active development. In general, `overlay2`, `aufs`, `overlay`,
and `devicemapper` are the choices with the highest stability.

### Test with your own workloads

You can test Docker's performance when running your own workloads on different
storage drivers. Make sure to use equivalent hardware and workloads to match
production conditions, so you can see which storage driver offers the best
overall performance.

## Check your current storage driver

The detailed documentation for each individual storage driver details all of the
set-up steps to use a given storage driver.

To see what storage driver Docker is currently using, use `docker info` and look
for the `Storage Driver` line:

```bash
$ docker info

Containers: 0
Images: 0
Storage Driver: overlay2
 Backing Filesystem: xfs
<...>
```

To change the storage driver, see the specific instructions for the new storage
driver. Some drivers require additional configuration, including configuration
to physical or logical disks on the Docker host.

> **Important**: When you change the storage driver, any existing images and
> containers become inaccessible. This is because their layers cannot be used
> by the new storage driver. If you revert your changes, you can
> access the old images and containers again, but any that you pulled or
> created using the new driver are then inaccessible.

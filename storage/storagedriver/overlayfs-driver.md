OverlayFS is a modern *union filesystem* that is similar to AUFS, but faster
and with a simpler implementation. Docker provides two storage drivers for
OverlayFS: the original `overlay`, and the newer and more stable `overlay2`.

This topic refers to the Linux kernel driver as `OverlayFS` and to the Docker
storage driver as `overlay` or `overlay2`.

> **Note**: If you use OverlayFS, use the `overlay2` driver rather than the
> `overlay` driver, because it is more efficient in terms of inode utilization.
> To use the new driver, you need version 4.0 or higher of the Linux kernel,
> unless you are a Docker EE user on RHEL or CentOS, in which case you need
> version 3.10.0-693 or higher of the kernel and to follow some extra steps.
>
> For more information about differences between `overlay` vs `overlay2`, check

## Prerequisites

OverlayFS is supported if you meet the following prerequisites:

- The `overlay2` driver is supported for Docker EE 17.06.02-ee5 and later and
  recommended for Docker CE.

- The `overlay` driver is allowed but not recommended for Docker CE.

- Version 4.0 or higher of the Linux kernel, or RHEL or CentOS using
  version 3.10.0-693 of the kernel or higher. Docker EE users using kernels older
  than 4.0 need to follow some extra steps, outlined below.
  If you use an older kernel, you need to use the `overlay` driver, which is not
  recommended.

- The following backing filesystems are supported:
  - `ext4` (RHEL 7.1 only)
  - `xfs` (RHEL 7.2 and higher), but only with `d_type=true` enabled. Use
    `xfs_info` to verify that the `ftype` option is set to `1`. To format an
    `xfs` filesystem correctly, use the flag `-n ftype=1`.

    > **Warning**: Running on XFS without d_type support now causes Docker to
    > skip the attempt to use the `overlay` or `overlay2` driver. Existing
    > installs will continue to run, but produce an error. This is to allow
    > users to migrate their data. In a future version, this will be a fatal
    > error, which will prevent Docker from starting.
    {:.warning}

- Changing the storage driver makes existing containers and images inaccessible
  on the local system. Use `docker save` to save any images you have built or
  push them to Docker Hub or a private registry, so that you do not need to
  re-create them later.


## Configure Docker with the `overlay` or `overlay2` storage driver

It is highly recommended that you use the `overlay2` driver if possible, rather
than the `overlay` driver. The `overlay` driver is **not** supported for
Docker EE.

To configure Docker to use the `overlay` storage driver your Docker host must be
running version 3.18 of the Linux kernel (preferably newer) with the overlay
kernel module loaded. For the `overlay2` driver, the version of your kernel must
be 4.0 or newer.

Before following this procedure, you must first meet all the
[prerequisites](#prerequisites).


1. Stop Docker.

   ```bash
   $ sudo systemctl stop docker
   ```

2.  Copy the contents of `/var/lib/docker` to a temporary location.

    ```bash
    $ cp -au /var/lib/docker /var/lib/docker.bk
    ```

3.  If you want to use a separate backing filesystem from the one used by
    `/var/lib/`, format the filesystem and mount it into `/var/lib/docker`.
    Make sure add this mount to `/etc/fstab` to make it permanent.

4.  Edit `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. If it does not yet exist, create it. Assuming
    that the file was empty, add the following contents.

    ```json
    {
      "storage-driver": "overlay2"
    }
    ```

    > **Note**: RHEL and CentOS users on Docker EE 17.06.02-ee5 and 17.06.02-ee6
    >
    > You need to add a second option to the `daemon.json` to disable the check
    > for version 4.0 or higher of the Linux kernel. Your `daemon.json` should
    > look like the following. **This is only needed for Docker EE users of RHEL
    > or CentOS.** Do not attempt to use `overlay2` with kernel versions older
    > than 3.10.0-693.
    >
    > ```json
    > {
    >   "storage-driver": "overlay2",
    >   "storage-opts": [
    >     "overlay2.override_kernel_check=true"
    >   ]
    > }
    > ```
    > On kernel versions that support it, Docker EE versions 17.06.02-ee7 and
    > later enable `overlay2` by default and do not require
    > `override_kernel_check`.

    If you need to use the legacy `overlay` driver, specify it instead.

    More storage options are available. See all storage options for each storage
    driver:

    - [Stable](/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd.md#storage-driver-options)
    - [Edge](/edge/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd.md#storage-driver-options)

    Docker does not start if the `daemon.json` file contains badly-formed JSON.

5.  Start Docker.

    ```bash
    $ sudo systemctl start docker
    ```

4.  Verify that the daemon is using the `overlay`/`overlay2` storage driver.
    Use the `docker info` command and look for `Storage Driver` and
    `Backing filesystem`.

    ```bash
    $ docker info

    Containers: 0
    Images: 0
    Storage Driver: overlay2
     Backing Filesystem: extfs
    <output truncated>
    ```

Docker is now using the `overlay2` storage driver. Docker has automatically
created the `overlay` mount with the required `lowerdir`, `upperdir`, `merged`,
and `workdir` constructs.

Continue reading for details about how OverlayFS works within your Docker
containers, as well as performance advice and information about limitations of
its compatibility with different backing filesystems.

## How the `overlay2` driver works

If you are still using the `overlay` driver rather than `overlay2`, see
[How the overlay driver works](#how-the-overlay-driver-works) instead.

OverlayFS layers two directories on a single Linux host and presents them as
a single directory. These directories are called _layers_ and the unification
process is referred to as a _union mount_. OverlayFS refers to the lower directory
as `lowerdir` and the upper directory a `upperdir`. The unified view is exposed
through its own directory called `merged`.

While the `overlay` driver only works with a single lower OverlayFS layer and
hence requires hard links for implementation of multi-layered images, the
`overlay2` driver natively supports up to 128 lower OverlayFS layers. This
capability provides better performance for layer-related Docker commands such
as `docker build` and `docker commit`, and consumes fewer inodes on the backing
filesystem.

### Image and container layers on-disk

After downloading a five-layer image using `docker pull ubuntu`, you can see
six directories under `/var/lib/docker/overlay2`.

> **Warning**: Do not directly manipulate any files or directories within
> `/var/lib/docker/`. These files and directories are managed by Docker.

```bash
$ ls -l /var/lib/docker/overlay2

The new `l` (lowercase `L`) directory contains shortened layer identifiers as
symbolic links. These identifiers are used to avoid hitting the page size
limitation on arguments to the `mount` command.

```bash
$ ls -l /var/lib/docker/overlay2/l

```

The lowest layer contains a file called `link`, which contains the name of the
shortened identifier, and a directory called `diff` which contains the
layer's contents.

```bash
$ ls /var/lib/docker/overlay2/3a36935c9df35472229c57f4a27105a136f5e4dbef0f87905b2e506e494e348b/

```

The second-lowest layer, and each higher layer, contain a file called `lower`,
which denotes its parent, and a directory called `diff` which contains its
contents. It also contains a `merged` directory, which contains the unified
contents of its parent layer and itself, and a `work` directory which is used
internally by OverlayFS.

```bash
$ ls /var/lib/docker/overlay2/223c2864175491657d238e2664251df13b63adb8d050924fd1bfcdb278b866f7

To view the mounts which exist when you use the `overlay` storage driver with
Docker, use the `mount` command. The output below is truncated for readability.

```bash
$ mount | grep overlay

overlay on /var/lib/docker/overlay2/9186877cdf386d0a3b016149cf30c208f326dca307529e646afce5b3f83f5304/merged

workdir=9186877cdf386d0a3b016149cf30c208f326dca307529e646afce5b3f83f5304/work)
```

The `rw` on the second line shows that the `overlay` mount is read-write.

## How the `overlay` driver works

This content applies to the `overlay` driver only. Docker recommends using the
`overlay2` driver, which works differently. See
[How the overlay2 driver works](#how-the-overlay2-driver-works)
for `overlay2`.

OverlayFS layers two directories on a single Linux host and presents them as
a single directory. These directories are called _layers_ and the unification
process is referred to a a _union mount_. OverlayFS refers to the lower directory
as `lowerdir` and the upper directory a `upperdir`. The unified view is exposed
through its own directory called `merged`.

The diagram below shows how a Docker image and a Docker container are layered.
The image layer is the `lowerdir` and the container layer is the `upperdir`.
The unified view is exposed through a directory called `merged` which is
effectively the containers mount point. The diagram shows how Docker constructs
map to OverlayFS constructs.

![overlayfs lowerdir, upperdir, merged](images/overlay_constructs.jpg)

Where the image layer and the container layer contain the same files, the
container layer "wins" and obscures the existence of the same files in the image
layer.

The `overlay` driver only works with two layers. This means that multi-layered
images cannot be implemented as multiple OverlayFS layers. Instead, each image
layer is implemented as its own directory under `/var/lib/docker/overlay`.  Hard
links are then used as a space-efficient way to reference data shared with lower
layers. As of Docker 1.10, image layer IDs no longer correspond to directory
names in `/var/lib/docker/`.

To create a container, the `overlay` driver combines the directory representing
the image's top layer plus a new directory for the container. The image's top
layer is the `lowerdir` in the overlay and is read-only. The new directory for
the container is the `upperdir` and is writable.

### Image and container layers on-disk

The following `docker pull` command shows a Docker host downloading a Docker
image comprising five layers.

```bash
$ docker pull ubuntu

Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/ubuntu

```

#### The image layers

Each image layer has its own directory within `/var/lib/docker/overlay/`, which
contains its contents, as shown below. The image layer IDs do not correspond to
the directory IDs.

> **Warning**: Do not directly manipulate any files or directories within
> `/var/lib/docker/`. These files and directories are managed by Docker.

```bash
$ ls -l /var/lib/docker/overlay/

```

The image layer directories contain the files unique to that layer as well as
hard links to the data that is shared with lower layers. This allows for
efficient use of disk space.

```bash
$ ls -i /var/lib/docker/overlay/38f3ed2eac129654acef11c32670b534670c3a06e483fce313d72e3e0a15baa8/root/bin/ls

$ ls -i /var/lib/docker/overlay/55f1e14c361b90570df46371b20ce6d480c434981cbda5fd68c6ff61aa0a5358/root/bin/ls

```

#### The container layer

Containers also exist on-disk in the Docker host's filesystem under
`/var/lib/docker/overlay/`. If you list a running container's subdirectory
using the `ls -l` command, three directories and one file exist:

```bash
$ ls -l /var/lib/docker/overlay/<directory-of-running-container>

total 16
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   64 Jun 20 16:39 lower-id
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Jun 20 16:39 merged
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Jun 20 16:39 upper
drwx------ 3 root root 4096 Jun 20 16:39 work
```

The `lower-id` file contains the ID of the top layer of the image the container
is based on, which is the OverlayFS `lowerdir`.

```bash
$ cat /var/lib/docker/overlay/ec444863a55a9f1ca2df72223d459c5d940a721b2288ff86a3f27be28b53be6c/lower-id

55f1e14c361b90570df46371b20ce6d480c434981cbda5fd68c6ff61aa0a5358
```

The `upper` directory contains the contents of the container's read-write layer,
which corresponds to the OverlayFS `upperdir`.

The `merged` directory is the union mount of the `lowerdir` and `upperdir`, which
comprises the view of the filesystem from within the running container.

The `work` directory is internal to OverlayFS.

To view the mounts which exist when you use the `overlay` storage driver with
Docker, use the `mount` command. The output below is truncated for readability.

```bash
$ mount | grep overlay

overlay on /var/lib/docker/overlay/ec444863a55a.../merged
type overlay (rw,relatime,lowerdir=/var/lib/docker/overlay/55f1e14c361b.../root,
upperdir=/var/lib/docker/overlay/ec444863a55a.../upper,
workdir=/var/lib/docker/overlay/ec444863a55a.../work)
```

The `rw` on the second line shows that the `overlay` mount is read-write.


## How container reads and writes work with `overlay` or `overlay2`

### Reading files

Consider three scenarios where a container opens a file for read access with
overlay.

- **The file does not exist in the container layer**: If a container opens a
  file for read access and the file does not already exist in the container
  (`upperdir`) it is read from the image (`lowerdir)`. This incurs very little
  performance overhead.

- **The file only exists in the container layer**: If a container opens a file
  for read access and the file exists in the container (`upperdir`) and not in
  the image (`lowerdir`), it is read directly from the container.

- **The file exists in both the container layer and the image layer**: If a
  container opens a file for read access and the file exists in the image layer
  and the container layer, the file's version in the container layer is read.
  Files in the container layer (`upperdir`) obscure files with the same name in
  the image layer (`lowerdir`).

### Modifying files or directories

Consider some scenarios where files in a container are modified.

- **Writing to a file for the first time**: The first time a container writes
  to an existing file, that file does not exist in the container (`upperdir`).
  The `overlay`/`overlay2` driver performs a *copy_up* operation to copy the file
  from the image (`lowerdir`) to the container (`upperdir`). The container then
  writes the changes to the new copy of the file in the container layer.

  However, OverlayFS works at the file level rather than the block level. This
  means that all OverlayFS copy_up operations copy the entire file, even if the\
  file is very large and only a small part of it is being modified. This can
  have a noticeable impact on container write performance. However, two things
  are worth noting:

  - The copy_up operation only occurs the first time a given file is written
    to. Subsequent writes to the same file operate against the copy of the file
    already copied up to the container.

  - OverlayFS only works with two layers. This means that performance should
    be better than AUFS, which can suffer noticeable latencies when searching
    for files in images with many layers. This advantage applies to both
    `overlay` and `overlay2` drivers. `overlayfs2` is slightly
    less performant than `overlayfs` on initial read, because it must look
    through more layers, but it caches the results so this is only a small
    penalty.

- **Deleting files and directories**:

  - When a _file_ is deleted within a container, a *whiteout* file is created in
    the container (`upperdir`). The version of the file in the image layer
    (`lowerdir`) is not deleted (because the `lowerdir` is read-only). However,
    the whiteout file prevents it from being available to the container.

  - When a _directory_ is deleted within a container, an _opaque directory_ is
    created within the container (`upperdir`). This works in the same way as a
    whiteout file and effectively prevents the directory from being accessed,
    even though it still exists in the image (`lowerdir`).

- **Renaming directories**: Calling `rename(2)` for a directory is allowed only
  when both the source and the destination path are on the top layer.
  Otherwise, it returns `EXDEV` error ("cross-device link not permitted").
  Your application needs to be designed to handle `EXDEV` and fall back to a
  "copy and unlink" strategy.


## OverlayFS and Docker Performance

Both `overlay2` and `overlay` drivers are more performant than `aufs` and
`devicemapper`. In certain circumstances, `overlay2` may perform better than
`btrfs` as well. However, be aware of the following details.

- **Page Caching**. OverlayFS supports page cache sharing. Multiple containers
  accessing the same file share a single page cache entry for that file. This
  makes the `overlay` and `overlay2` drivers efficient with memory and a good
  option for high-density use cases such as PaaS.

- **copy_up**. As with AUFS, OverlayFS performs copy-up operations
  whenever a container writes to a file for the first time. This can add latency
  into the write operation, especially for large files. However, once the file
  has been copied up, all subsequent writes to that file occur in the upper
  layer, without the need for further copy-up operations.

  The OverlayFS `copy_up` operation is faster than the same operation with AUFS,
  because AUFS supports more layers than OverlayFS and it is possible to incur
  far larger latencies if searching through many AUFS layers. `overlay2` supports
  multiple layers as well, but mitigates any performance hit with caching.

- **Inode limits**. Use of the `overlay` storage driver can cause excessive
  inode consumption. This is especially true in the presence of a large number
  of images and containers on the Docker host. The only way to increase the
  number of inodes available to a filesystem is to reformat it. To avoid running
  into this issue, it is highly recommended that you use `overlay2` if at all
  possible.


### Performance best practices

The following generic performance best practices also apply to OverlayFS.

- **Use fast storage**: Solid-state drives (SSDs) provide faster reads and
  writes than spinning disks.

- **Use volumes for write-heavy workloads**: Volumes provide the best and most
  predictable performance for write-heavy workloads. This is because they bypass
  the storage driver and do not incur any of the potential overheads introduced
  by thin provisioning and copy-on-write. Volumes have other benefits, such as
  allowing you to share data among containers and persisting even when no
  running container is using them.

## Limitations on OverlayFS compatibility
To summarize the OverlayFS's aspect which is incompatible with other
filesystems:

- **open(2)**: OverlayFS only implements a subset of the POSIX standards.
  This can result in certain OverlayFS operations breaking POSIX standards. One
  such operation is the *copy-up* operation. Suppose that  your application calls
  `fd1=open("foo", O_RDONLY)` and then `fd2=open("foo", O_RDWR)`. In this case,
  your application expects `fd1` and `fd2` to refer to the same file. However, due
  to a copy-up operation that occurs after the second calling to `open(2)`, the
  descriptors refer to different files. The `fd1` continues to reference the file
  in the image (`lowerdir`) and the `fd2` references the file in the container
  (`upperdir`). A workaround for this is to `touch` the files which causes the
  copy-up operation to happen. All subsequent `open(2)` operations regardless of
  read-only or read-write access mode reference the file in the
  container (`upperdir`).

  `yum` is known to be affected unless the `yum-plugin-ovl` package is installed.
  If the `yum-plugin-ovl` package is not available in your distribution such as
  RHEL/CentOS prior to 6.8 or 7.2, you may need to run `touch /var/lib/rpm/*`
  before running `yum install`. This package implements the `touch` workaround
  referenced above for `yum`.

- **rename(2)**: OverlayFS does not fully support the `rename(2)` system call.
  Your application needs to detect its failure and fall back to a "copy and
  unlink" strategy.

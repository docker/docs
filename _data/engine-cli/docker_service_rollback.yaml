  ### Roll back to the previous version of a service

  Use the `docker service rollback` command to roll back to the previous version
  of a service. After executing this command, the service is reverted to the
  configuration that was in place before the most recent `docker service update`
  command.

  The following example creates a service with a single replica, updates the
  service to use three replicas, and then rolls back the service to the
  previous version, having one replica.

  Create a service with a single replica:

  ```console
  $ docker service create --name my-service -p 8080:80 nginx:alpine
  ```

  Confirm that the service is running with a single replica:

  ```console
  $ docker service ls

  ID                  NAME                MODE                REPLICAS            IMAGE               PORTS
  xbw728mf6q0d        my-service          replicated          1/1                 nginx:alpine        *:8080->80/tcp
  ```

  Update the service to use three replicas:

  ```console
  $ docker service update --replicas=3 my-service

  $ docker service ls

  ID                  NAME                MODE                REPLICAS            IMAGE               PORTS
  xbw728mf6q0d        my-service          replicated          3/3                 nginx:alpine        *:8080->80/tcp
  ```

  Now roll back the service to its previous version, and confirm it is
  running a single replica again:

  ```console
  $ docker service rollback my-service

  $ docker service ls

  ID                  NAME                MODE                REPLICAS            IMAGE               PORTS
  xbw728mf6q0d        my-service          replicated          1/1                 nginx:alpine        *:8080->80/tcp
  ```

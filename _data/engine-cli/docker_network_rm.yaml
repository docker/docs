command: docker network rm
aliases: remove
short: Remove one or more networks
long: |-
  Removes one or more networks by name or identifier. To remove a network,
  you must first disconnect any containers connected to it.
usage: docker network rm NETWORK [NETWORK...]
pname: docker network
plink: docker_network.yaml
examples: |-
  ### Remove a network

  To remove the network named 'my-network':

  ```console
  $ docker network rm my-network
  ```

  ### Remove multiple networks

  To delete multiple networks in a single `docker network rm` command, provide
  multiple network names or ids. The following example deletes a network with id
  `3695c422697f` and a network named `my-network`:

  ```console
  $ docker network rm 3695c422697f my-network
  ```

  When you specify multiple networks, the command attempts to delete each in turn.
  If the deletion of one network fails, the command continues to the next on the
  list and tries to delete that. The command reports success or failure for each
  deletion.

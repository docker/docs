command: docker wait
short: Block until one or more containers stop, then print their exit codes
long: Block until one or more containers stop, then print their exit codes
usage: docker wait CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]
pname: docker
plink: docker.yaml
examples: |-
  Start a container in the background.

  ```console
  $ docker run -dit --name=my_container ubuntu bash
  ```

  Run `docker wait`, which should block until the container exits.

  ```console
  $ docker wait my_container
  ```

  In another terminal, stop the first container. The `docker wait` command above
  returns the exit code.

  ```console
  $ docker stop my_container
  ```

  This is the same `docker wait` command from above, but it now exits, returning
  `0`.

  ```console
  $ docker wait my_container

  0
  ```

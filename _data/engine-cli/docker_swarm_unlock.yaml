command: docker swarm unlock
short: Unlock swarm
long: |-
  Unlocks a locked manager using a user-supplied unlock key. This command must be
  used to reactivate a manager after its Docker daemon restarts if the autolock
  setting is turned on. The unlock key is printed at the time when autolock is
  enabled, and is also available from the `docker swarm unlock-key` command.

  > **Note**
  >
  > This is a cluster management command, and must be executed on a swarm
  > manager node. To learn about managers and workers, refer to the
  > [Swarm mode section](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) in the
  > documentation.

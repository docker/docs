command: docker swarm unlock-key
short: Manage the unlock key
long: |-
  An unlock key is a secret key needed to unlock a manager after its Docker daemon
  restarts. These keys are only used when the autolock feature is enabled for the
  swarm.

  You can view or rotate the unlock key using `swarm unlock-key`. To view the key,
  run the `docker swarm unlock-key` command without any arguments:

  ```bash
  $ docker swarm unlock-key

  To unlock a swarm manager after it restarts, run the `docker swarm unlock`
  command and provide the following key:

      SWMKEY-1-fySn8TY4w5lKcWcJPIpKufejh9hxx5KYwx6XZigx3Q4

  Please remember to store this key in a password manager, since without it you
  will not be able to restart the manager.
  ```

  Use the `--rotate` flag to rotate the unlock key to a new, randomly-generated
  key:

  ```bash
  $ docker swarm unlock-key --rotate

  Successfully rotated manager unlock key.

  To unlock a swarm manager after it restarts, run the `docker swarm unlock`
  command and provide the following key:

      SWMKEY-1-7c37Cc8654o6p38HnroywCi19pllOnGtbdZEgtKxZu8

  Please remember to store this key in a password manager, since without it you
  will not be able to restart the manager.
  ```

  The `-q` (or `--quiet`) flag only prints the key:

  ```bash
  $ docker swarm unlock-key -q

  SWMKEY-1-7c37Cc8654o6p38HnroywCi19pllOnGtbdZEgtKxZu8
  ```

  ### `--rotate`

  This flag rotates the unlock key, replacing it with a new randomly-generated
  key. The old unlock key will no longer be accepted.

  ### `--quiet`

  Only print the unlock key, without instructions.

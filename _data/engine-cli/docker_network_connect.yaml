command: docker network connect
short: Connect a container to a network
long: |-
  Connects a container to a network. You can connect a container by name
  or by ID. Once connected, the container can communicate with other containers in
  the same network.

examples: |-
  ### Connect a running container to a network

  ```bash
  $ docker network connect multi-host-network container1
  ```

  ### Connect a container to a network when it starts

  You can also use the `docker run --network=<network-name>` option to start a container and immediately connect it to a network.

  ```bash
  $ docker run -itd --network=multi-host-network busybox
  ```

  ### Specify the IP address a container will use on a given network

  You can specify the IP address you want to be assigned to the container's interface.

  ```bash
  $ docker network connect --ip 10.10.36.122 multi-host-network container2
  ```

  ### Use the legacy `--link` option

  You can use `--link` option to link another container with a preferred alias

  ```bash
  $ docker network connect --link container1:c1 multi-host-network container2
  ```

  ### Create a network alias for a container

  `--alias` option can be used to resolve the container by another name in the network
  being connected to.

  ```bash
  $ docker network connect --alias db --alias mysql multi-host-network container2
  ```

  ### Network implications of stopping, pausing, or restarting containers

  You can pause, restart, and stop containers that are connected to a network.
  A container connects to its configured networks when it runs.

  If specified, the container's IP address(es) is reapplied when a stopped
  container is restarted. If the IP address is no longer available, the container
  fails to start. One way to guarantee that the IP address is available is
  to specify an `--ip-range` when creating the network, and choose the static IP
  address(es) from outside that range. This ensures that the IP address is not
  given to another container while this container is not on the network.

  ```bash
  $ docker network create --subnet 172.20.0.0/16 --ip-range 172.20.240.0/20 multi-host-network
  ```

  ```bash
  $ docker network connect --ip 172.20.128.2 multi-host-network container2
  ```

  To verify the container is connected, use the `docker network inspect` command. Use `docker network disconnect` to remove a container from the network.

  Once connected in network, containers can communicate using only another
  container's IP address or name. For `overlay` networks or custom plugins that
  support multi-host connectivity, containers connected to the same multi-host
  network but launched from different Engines can also communicate in this way.

  You can connect a container to one or more networks. The networks need not be the same type. For example, you can connect a single container bridge and overlay networks.

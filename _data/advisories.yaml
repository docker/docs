#TODO: work out how to add a data dir to any repo that has documentation
# atm, repo's have a docs dir that is akin to the hugo content dir.


# Define Advisory texts
# can be used in page frontmatter, e.g.:
#       advisory: experimental

texts:
  experimental: "The functionality described on this page is marked as Experimental, and as such, may change before it becomes generally available."
  rc: "The Swarm mode feature included in Docker Engine 1.12 is a release candidate feature and might be subject to non backward-compatible changes. Some functionality may change before the feature becomes generally available."
  docker4mac-beta: "Docker Desktop for Mac is currently in public beta. Some functionality may change before the product becomes generally available."
  docker4win-beta: "Docker Desktop for Windows is currently in public beta. Some functionality may change before the product becomes generally available."
  toolbox: "**Legacy desktop solution.** Docker Toolbox is for older Mac and Windows systems that do not meet the requirements of [Docker Desktop for Mac](/docker-for-mac/) and [Docker Desktop for Windows](/docker-for-windows/). We recommend updating to the newer applications, if possible."
  kitematic: "**Legacy desktop solution.** Kitematic is a legacy solution, bundled with [Docker Toolbox](/toolbox/overview/). We recommend updating to [Docker Desktop for Mac](/docker-for-mac/) or [Docker Desktop for Windows](/docker-for-windows/) if your system meets the requirements for one of those applications."
  swarm: "See [Swarm mode overview](/engine/swarm/) for the orchestration features introduced in Docker Engine 1.12. Only refer to the Docker Swarm documents below for information on the standalone Swarm product."
  swarm-standalone: "**You are viewing docs for legacy standalone Swarm.** These topics describe standalone Docker Swarm. In Docker 1.12 and higher, [Swarm mode](/engine/swarm/) is integrated with Docker Engine. Most users should use integrated Swarm mode &#8212; a good place to start is [Getting started with swarm mode](/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/), [Swarm mode CLI commands](/engine/swarm/#swarm-mode-cli-commands), and the [Get started with Docker walkthrough](/get-started/)). Standalone Docker Swarm is not integrated into the Docker Engine API and CLI commands."
  engine: "This site contains documentation for the v1.12 release candidate version of Docker Engine. For the Docker Engine v1.11 docs, see [https://docs.docker.com/v1.11/](https://docs.docker.com/v1.11/). Docker Desktop for Mac and Docker Desktop for Windows are currently in Beta."


# URL based advisories
# any URL that begins with "/engine/" will get the "engine" advisory
# will be over-ridden by the `advisory` frontmatter in the topic
# [paths]
# "/engine/" = "engine"
# "/swarm/" = "swarm"

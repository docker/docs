command: docker service logs
short: Fetch the logs of a service
long: |-
  The `docker service logs` command batch-retrieves logs present at the time of execution.

  > **Note**: This command is only functional for services that are started with
  > the `json-file` or `journald` logging driver.

  For more information about selecting and configuring logging drivers, refer to
  [Configure logging drivers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/).

  The `docker service logs --follow` command will continue streaming the new output from
  the service's `STDOUT` and `STDERR`.

  Passing a negative number or a non-integer to `--tail` is invalid and the
  value is set to `all` in that case.

  The `docker service logs --timestamps` command will add an [RFC3339Nano timestamp](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#pkg-constants)
  , for example `2014-09-16T06:17:46.000000000Z`, to each
  log entry. To ensure that the timestamps are aligned the
  nano-second part of the timestamp will be padded with zero when necessary.

  The `docker service logs --details` command will add on extra attributes, such as
  environment variables and labels, provided to `--log-opt` when creating the
  service.

  The `--since` option shows only the service logs generated after
  a given date. You can specify the date as an RFC 3339 date, a UNIX
  timestamp, or a Go duration string (e.g. `1m30s`, `3h`). Besides RFC3339 date
  format you may also use RFC3339Nano, `2006-01-02T15:04:05`,
  `2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999`, `2006-01-02Z07:00`, and `2006-01-02`. The local
  timezone on the client will be used if you do not provide either a `Z` or a
  `+-00:00` timezone offset at the end of the timestamp. When providing Unix
  timestamps enter seconds[.nanoseconds], where seconds is the number of seconds
  that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 (midnight UTC/GMT), not counting leap
  seconds (aka Unix epoch or Unix time), and the optional .nanoseconds field is a
  fraction of a second no more than nine digits long. You can combine the
  `--since` option with either or both of the `--follow` or `--tail` options.

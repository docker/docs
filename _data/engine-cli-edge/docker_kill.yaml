command: docker kill
short: Kill one or more running containers
long: |-
  The main process inside the container will be sent `SIGKILL`, or any
  signal specified with option `--signal`.

  > **Note**: `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` in the *shell* form run as a subcommand of
  > `/bin/sh -c`, which does not pass signals. This means that the executable is
  > not the container’s PID 1 and does not receive Unix signals.

  ### Get information about a builder instance

  By default, `inspect` shows information about the current builder. Specify the
  name of the builder to inspect to get information about that builder.
  The following example shows information about a builder instance named
  `elated_tesla`:

  ```console
  $ docker buildx inspect elated_tesla

  Name:   elated_tesla
  Driver: docker-container

  Nodes:
  Name:      elated_tesla0
  Endpoint:  unix:///var/run/docker.sock
  Status:    running
  Platforms: linux/amd64

  Name:      elated_tesla1
  Endpoint:  ssh://ubuntu@1.2.3.4
  Status:    running
  Platforms: linux/arm64, linux/arm/v7, linux/arm/v6
  ```

  ### Ensure that the builder is running before inspecting (--bootstrap) {#bootstrap}

  Use the `--bootstrap` option to ensure that the builder is running before
  inspecting it. If the driver is `docker-container`, then `--bootstrap` starts
  the buildkit container and waits until it is operational. Bootstrapping is
  automatically done during build, and therefore not necessary. The same BuildKit
  container is used during the lifetime of the associated builder node (as
  displayed in `buildx ls`).

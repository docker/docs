command: docker compose down
short: Stop and remove containers, networks
long: |-
  Stops containers and removes containers, networks, volumes, and images created by `up`.

  By default, the only things removed are:

  - Containers for services defined in the Compose file
  - Networks defined in the networks section of the Compose file
  - The default network, if one is used

  Networks and volumes defined as external are never removed.

  Anonymous volumes are not removed by default. However, as they donâ€™t have a stable name, they will not be automatically
  mounted by a subsequent `up`. For data that needs to persist between updates, use explicit paths as bind mounts or
  named volumes.

command: docker init
short: Creates Docker-related starter files for your project
long: |-
  Initialize a project with the files necessary to run the project in a container.

  Docker Desktop 4.18 and later provides the Docker Init plugin with the `docker init` CLI command. Run `docker init` in your project directory to be walked through the creation of the following files with sensible defaults for your project:
    
    * .dockerignore
    * Dockerfile
    * compose.yaml
    
    If any of the files already exist, a prompt appears and provides a warning as well as giving you the option to overwrite all the files.
    
    > **Warning**
    >
    > You can't recover overwritten files.
    > To back up an existing file before selecting to overwrite it, rename the file or copy it to another directory.
    {: .warning}
  
  After running `docker init`, you can choose one of the following templates:
    
    * Go: Suitable for a Go server application.
    * Python: Suitable for a Python server application.
    * Node: Suitable for a Node server application.
    * Other: General purpose starting point for containerizing your application.
  
  After `docker init` has completed, you may need to modify the created files and tailor them to your project. Visit the following topics to learn more about the files:
    
    * [.dockerignore](../../../engine/reference/builder.md#dockerignore-file)
    * [Dockerfile](../../../engine/reference/builder.md)
    * [compose.yaml](../../../compose/compose-file/03-compose-file.md)

  ### Example of running `docker init`
  
  The following example shows the initial menu after running `docker init`. See the additional examples to view the options for each language or framework.
  
  ```console
  $ docker init
  
  Welcome to the Docker Init CLI!
  
  This utility will walk you through creating the following files with sensible defaults for your project:
    - .dockerignore
    - Dockerfile
    - compose.yaml
  
  Let's get started!
  
  ? What application platform does your project use?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
  > Go - (detected) suitable for a Go server application
    Python - suitable for a Python server application
    Node - suitable for a Node server application
    Other - general purpose starting point for containerizing your application
    Don't see something you need? Let us know!
    Quit
  ```

  ### Example of selecting Go
  
  The following example shows the prompts that appear after selecting `Go` and example input.
  
  ```console
  ? What application platform does your project use? Go
  ? What version of Go do you want to use? 1.20
  ? What's the relative directory (with a leading .) of your main package? .
  ? What port does your server listen on? 3333

  CREATED: .dockerignore
  CREATED: Dockerfile
  CREATED: compose.yaml
  
  ✔ Your Docker files are ready!
  
  Take a moment to review them and tailor them to your application.
  
  When you're ready, start your application by running: docker compose up --build
  
  Your application will be available at http://localhost:3333
  ```
  
  ### Example of selecting Python

  ```console
  ? What application platform does your project use? Python
  ? What version of Python do you want to use? 3.8
  ? What port do you want your app to listen on? 8000
  ? What is the command to run your app (e.g., gunicorn 'myapp.example:app' --bind=0.0.0.0:8000)? python ./app.py
  
  CREATED: .dockerignore
  CREATED: Dockerfile
  CREATED: compose.yaml
  
  ✔ Your Docker files are ready!
  
  Take a moment to review them and tailor them to your application.
  
  When you're ready, start your application by running: docker compose up --build
  
  Your application will be available at http://localhost:8000
  ```
  
  ### Example of selecting Node
  
  The following example shows the prompts that appear after selecting `Node` and example input.

  ```
  
  ### Example of selecting Other
  
  The following example shows the output after selecting `Other`.
  
  ```console
  ? What application platform does your project use? Other
  
  CREATED: .dockerignore
  CREATED: Dockerfile
  CREATED: compose.yaml
  
  ✔ Your Docker files are ready!
  
  Take a moment to review them and tailor them to your application.

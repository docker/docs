Docker and the broader community of Docker experts have put together many different ways to get further training and hands-on experience with Docker. Expand your understanding of Docker and Kubernetes with these additional free and paid resources.

## Hosted labs

These self-paced and hands-on workshops use a free, hosted environment ([Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}) that does not require any installation. Follow along and learn more about Kubernetes.

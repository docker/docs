Docker and the broader community of Docker experts have put together many different ways to get further training and hands-on experience with Docker. Expand your understanding of Docker and Kubernetes with these additional free and paid resources.

## Hosted labs

These self-paced and hands-on workshops use free, hosted environments ([Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) and [Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)) that do not require anything to be installed. Follow along and learn more about Docker and Kubernetes.

* [Kubernetes Workshop](https://training.play-with-kubernetes.com/kubernetes-workshop/)
* [Microservice containerization and orchestration](https://training.play-with-docker.com/microservice-orchestration/)

\* Labs are free but require registration with a Docker ID.

Created by experts in the Docker community, these free tutorials provide guided step-by-step workflows for working with the Docker platform.

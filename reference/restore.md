# docker/ucp id

Restore a UCP cluster from a backup tar file.

## Usage

```bash
docker run --rm -i \
  --name ucp \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  docker/ucp \
  restore [command options] < backup.tar
```

## Description

This utility will restore the state of this controller based on a tar file
generated by the 'backup' command.  Any UCP containers that are running on this
host will be stopped prior to restoring the data. After the data is replaced,
the containers will be restarted.

The full restore operation can be only performed on the same node where a backup
was taken. Other controllers of the cluster need to be stopped before attempting
a restore operation.

The restore operation can be also used to replicate Root CA material across
controllers in the same cluster, by using the --root-ca-only flag. In this case,
no controllers need to be stopped and the same backup file can be used to
replicate Root CA material across multiple controllers of the same cluster.

WARNING: Existing state on this node will be lost and replaced by the
contents of the backup.

When the restore operation is run using --interactive mode, the backup file
needs to be mounted under /backup.tar within this container. If the
--interactive flag is not set, the backup file  will be read from stdin.

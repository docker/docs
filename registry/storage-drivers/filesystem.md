{% include registry.md %}

An implementation of the `storagedriver.StorageDriver` interface which uses the local filesystem.

## Parameters

* `rootdirectory`: (optional) The absolute path to a root directory tree in which
to store all registry files. The registry stores all its data here so make sure
there is adequate space available. Defaults to `/var/lib/registry`. If the directory
does not exist, it will be created honoring [`umask`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/umask.2.html)
bits. If `umask` bits are not set, the resulting permission will be `0777`.
* `maxthreads`: (optional) The maximum number of simultaneous blocking filesystem
operations permitted within the registry. Each operation spawns a new thread and
may cause thread exhaustion issues if many are done in parallel. Defaults to
`100`, and cannot be lower than `25`.

examples: |-
    ### Pulling a model from Docker Hub

    ```console
    docker model pull ai/smollm2
    ```

    ### Pulling from HuggingFace

    You can pull GGUF models directly from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?library=gguf).

    **Note about quantization:** If no tag is specified, the command tries to pull the `Q4_K_M` version of the model.
    If `Q4_K_M` doesn't exist, the command pulls the first GGUF found in the **Files** view of the model on HuggingFace.
    To specify the quantization, provide it as a tag, for example:
    `docker model pull hf.co/bartowski/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF:Q4_K_S`

    ```console
    docker model pull hf.co/bartowski/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF
    ```

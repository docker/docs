command: docker model run
short: Run a model and interact with it using a submitted prompt or chat mode
long: |-
    When you run a model, Docker calls an inference server API endpoint hosted by the Model Runner through Docker Desktop. The model stays in memory until another model is requested, or until a pre-defined inactivity timeout is reached (currently 5 minutes).

    You do not have to use Docker model run before interacting with a specific model from a host process or from within a container. Model Runner transparently loads the requested model on-demand, assuming it has been pulled and is locally available.

    You can also use chat mode in the Docker Desktop Dashboard when you select the model in the **Models** tab.

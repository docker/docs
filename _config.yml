# Options for displaying minimum API version requirements in the reference pages.
#
# The reference pages show badges for commands and options (flags) that require
# a minimum API version. While this information can be useful if an option was
# added in a recent version of the Docker Engine (and API), these badges are no
# longer relevant to most users if the minimum required version is quite "old".
#
# We assume users reading these pages to be on the current version, or at most
# on the version before that (which is already "unsupported"). Users running
# older versions have bigger problems on their hand, so we're not accounting for
# those.
#
# So, to reduce unnecessary clutter on the page, we only show the minimum required
# API version if it requires a relatively recent version of the Engine.
#
# The "min_api_threshold" option specifies the minimum required API version for
# which we show a badge (currently: API v1.40, or "Docker 19.03").
min_api_threshold: 1.40

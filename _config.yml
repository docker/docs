# Options for displaying minimum API version requirements in the reference pages.
#
# The reference pages show badges for commands and options (flags) that require
# a minimum API version. While this information can be useful if an option was
# added in a recent version of the Docker Engine (and API), these badges are no
# longer relevant to most users if the minimum required version is quite "old".
#
# We assume users reading these pages to be on the current version, or at most
# on the version before that (which is already "unsupported"). Users running
# older versions have bigger problems on their hand, so we're not accounting for
# those.
#
# So, to reduce unnecessary clutter on the page, we only show the minimum required
# API version if it requires a relatively recent version of the Engine.
#
# The "min_api_threshold" option specifies the minimum required API version for
# which we show a badge (currently: API v1.40, or "Docker 19.03").
min_api_threshold: 1.40

# List of plugins to enable for local development builds. Mostly the same as
# for production, but without the "jekyll-sitemap" plugin, which is not needed
# for previewing, and excluding saves some time to build
plugins:
  - jekyll-redirect-from
  - jekyll-relative-links

# Assets
#
# We specify the directory for Jekyll so we can use @imports.
#
# For local development, we build css with the "expanded" format to produce
# human-readable output for easier debugging.
sass:
  sass_dir: _scss
  style: expanded

# Set default options / metadata for some paths.
#
# Setting options here prevents having to repeat the same option in front-matter
# on every page. Avoid using wildcards, such as "path: engine/api/v1.*", as
# limitations in Jekyll cause those to introduce a _severe_ impact on build-time,
# affecting generation of (e.g.) sitemap.xml and metadata.json, resulting in the
# total build to take 60 seconds longer to build (!).
#
# The list below is for "development" (local builds, and PR previews) builds only,
# and should be kept minimal to allow for fast builds. Other options should go
# into _config_production.yml, which is used for production deploys.

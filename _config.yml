# List of plugins to enable for local development builds. Mostly the same as
# for production, but without the "jekyll-sitemap" plugin, which is not needed
# for previewing, and excluding saves some time to build
plugins:
  - jekyll-redirect-from
  - jekyll-relative-links

# Assets
#
# We specify the directory for Jekyll so we can use @imports.
#
# For local development, we build css with the "expanded" format to produce
# human-readable output for easier debugging.
sass:
  sass_dir: _scss
  style: expanded

# Set default options / metadata for some paths.
#
# Setting options here prevents having to repeat the same option in front-matter
# on every page. Avoid using wildcards, such as "path: engine/api/v1.*", as
# limitations in Jekyll cause those to introduce a _severe_ impact on build-time,
# affecting generation of (e.g.) sitemap.xml and metadata.json, resulting in the
# total build to take 60 seconds longer to build (!).
#
# The list below is for "development" (local builds, and PR previews) builds only,
# and should be kept minimal to allow for fast builds. Other options should go
# into _config_production.yml, which is used for production deploys.

+# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
+# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
+# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
+# documentation.
+
+# 💁 The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
+# - Checkout your repository
+# - Perform a container image build
+# - Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
+# - Log in to your OpenShift cluster
+# - Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet
+
+# ℹ️ Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:
+# 1. Have access to an OpenShift cluster. Refer to https://www.openshift.com/try
+# 2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER and OPENSHIFT_TOKEN repository secrets. Refer to:
+#   - https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#readme
+#   - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets
+#   - https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_secret_set
+# 3. (Optional) Edit the top-level 'env' section as marked with '🖊️' if the defaults are not suitable for your project.
+# 4. (Optional) Edit the build-image step to build your project.
+#    The default build type is by using a Dockerfile at the root of the repository,
+#    but can be replaced with a different file, a source-to-image build, or a step-by-step buildah build.
+# 5. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.
+
+# 👋 Visit our GitHub organization at https://github.com/redhat-actions/ to see our actions and provide feedback.

+# This workflow will build and push a new container image to Amazon ECR,
+# and then will deploy a new task definition to Amazon ECS, when there is a push to the "paradice" branch.
+#
+# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps:
+#
+# 1. Create an ECR repository to store your images.
+#    For example: `aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-ecr-repo --region us-east-2`.
+#    Replace the value of the `ECR_REPOSITORY` environment variable in the workflow below with your repository's name.
+#    Replace the value of the `AWS_REGION` environment variable in the workflow below with your repository's region.
+#
+# 2. Create an ECS task definition, an ECS cluster, and an ECS service.
+#    For example, follow the Getting Started guide on the ECS console:
+#      https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-2#/firstRun
+#    Replace the value of the `ECS_SERVICE` environment variable in the workflow below with the name you set for the Amazon ECS service.
+#    Replace the value of the `ECS_CLUSTER` environment variable in the workflow below with the name you set for the cluster.
+#
+# 3. Store your ECS task definition as a JSON file in your repository.
+#    The format should follow the output of `aws ecs register-task-definition --generate-cli-skeleton`.
+#    Replace the value of the `ECS_TASK_DEFINITION` environment variable in the workflow below with the path to the JSON file.
+#    Replace the value of the `CONTAINER_NAME` environment variable in the workflow below with the name of the container
+#    in the `containerDefinitions` section of the task definition.
+#
+# 4. Store an IAM user access key in GitHub Actions secrets named `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
+#    See the documentation for each action used below for the recommended IAM policies for this IAM user,
+#    and best practices on handling the access key credentials.

+
+> A hydrated Octokit client.
+
+## Usage
+Returns an authenticated Octokit client that follows the machine [proxy settings](https://help.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/using-a-proxy-server-with-self-hosted-runners) and correctly sets GHES base urls. See https://octokit.github.io/rest.js for the API.
+```js
+const github = require('@actions/github');
+const core = require('@actions/core');
+async function run() {
+    // This should be a token with access to your repository scoped in as a secret.
+    // The YML workflow will need to set myToken with the GitHub Secret Token
+    // myToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
+    // https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/authenticating-with-the-github_token#about-the-github_token-secret
+    const myToken = core.getInput('myToken');
+    const octokit = github.getOctokit(myToken)
+    // You can also pass in additional options as a second parameter to getOctokit
+    // const octokit = github.getOctokit(myToken, {userAgent: "MyActionVersion1"});
+    const { data: pullRequest } = await octokit.rest.pulls.get({
+        owner: 'octokit',
+        repo: 'rest.js',
+        pull_number: 123,
+        mediaType: {
+          format: 'diff'
+        }
+    });
+    console.log(pullRequest);
+}
+run();
+```
+You can also make GraphQL requests. See https://github.com/octokit/graphql.js for the API.
+```js
+const result = await octokit.graphql(query, variables);
+```
+Finally, you can get the context of the current action:
+```js
+const github = require('@actions/github');
+const context = github.context;
+const newIssue = await octokit.rest.issues.create({
+  ...context.repo,
+  title: 'New issue!',
+  body: 'Hello Universe!'
+});
+```
+## Webhook payload typescript definitions
+The npm module `@octokit/webhooks-definitions` provides type definitions for the response payloads. You can cast the payload to these types for better type information.
+First, install the npm module `npm install @octokit/webhooks-definitions`
+Then, assert the type based on the eventName
+```ts
+import * as core from '@actions/core'
+import * as github from '@actions/github'
+import {PushEvent} from '@octokit/webhooks-definitions/schema'
+if (github.context.eventName === 'push') {
+  const pushPayload = github.context.payload as PushEvent
+  core.info(`The head commit is: ${pushPayload.head_commit}`)
+}
+```
+## Extending the Octokit instance
+`@octokit/core` now supports the [plugin architecture](https://github.com/octokit/core.js#plugins). You can extend the GitHub instance using plugins. 
+For example, using the `@octokit/plugin-enterprise-server` you can now access enterprise admin apis on GHES instances.
+```ts
+import { GitHub, getOctokitOptions } from '@actions/github/lib/utils'
+import { enterpriseServer220Admin } from '@octokit/plugin-enterprise-server'
+const octokit = GitHub.plugin(enterpriseServer220Admin)
+// or override some of the default values as well 
+// const octokit = GitHub.plugin(enterpriseServer220Admin).defaults({userAgent: "MyNewUserAgent"})
+const myToken = core.getInput('myToken');
+const myOctokit = new octokit(getOctokitOptions(token))
+// Create a new user
+myOctokit.rest.enterpriseAdmin.createUser({
+  login: "testuser",
+  email: "testuser@test.com",
+'"'sign'-in'"':'' '"'Octookit",
+e'-mail':'' '"shining'_120'@yahoo'.com'"',''
+});
+```

+➰ Versioning
+Actions are downloaded and run from the GitHub graph of repos. This contains guidance for versioning actions and safe releases.
+⚠️ Problem Matchers
+Problem Matchers are a way to scan the output of actions for a specified regex pattern and surface that information prominently in the UI.
+⚠️ Proxy Server Support
+Self-hosted runners can be configured to run behind proxy servers.

+Create Pull Request CI GitHub Marketplace
+A GitHub action to create a pull request for changes to your repository in the actions workspace.
+Changes to a repository in the Actions workspace persist between steps in a workflow. This action is designed to be used in conjunction with other steps that modify or add files to your repository. The changes will be automatically committed to a new branch and a pull request created.
+Create Pull Request action will:
+Check for repository changes in the Actions workspace. This includes:
+untracked (new) files
+tracked (modified) files
+commits made during the workflow that have not been pushed
+Commit all changes to a new branch, or update an existing pull request branch.
+Create a pull request to merge the new branch into the base—the branch checked out in the workflow.
+Documentation
+Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage
+Examples
+Updating to v3
+Usage
+- uses: actions/checkout@v2
+# Make changes to pull request here
+name: Create Pull Request
+uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
+You can also pin to a specific release version in the format @v3.x.x
+Action inputs
+All inputs are optional. If not set, sensible defaults will be used.
+Note: If you want pull requests created by this action to trigge-on: worksflows_call:-on:'Run:run-on:-,oon:Name Description Default
+token GITHUB_TOKEN or a repo scoped Personal Access Token (PAT). GITHUB_TOKEN
+path Relative path under GITHUB_WORKSPACE to the repository. GITHUB_WORKSPACE
+commit-message The message to use when committing changes. [create-pull-request] automated change
+committer The committer name and email address in the format Display Name email@address.com. Defaults to the GitHub Actions bot user. GitHub noreply@github.com
+author The author name and email address in the format Display Name email@address.com. Defaults to the user who triggered the workflow run. {{ github.actor }}@users.noreply.github.com>
+signoff Add Signed-off-by line by the committer at the end of the commit log message. false
+branch The pull request branch name. create-pull-request/patch
+delete-branch Delete the branch when closing pull requests, and when undeleted after merging. Recommend true. false
+branch-suffix The branch suffix type when using the alternative branching strategy. Valid values are random, timestamp and short-commit-hash. See Alternative strategy for details.
+base Sets the pull request base branch. Defaults to the branch checked out in the workflow.
+push-to-fork A fork of the checked-out parent repository to which the pull request branch will be pushed. e.g. owner/repo-fork. The pull request will be created to merge the fork's branch into the parent's base. See push pull request branches to a fork for details.
+title The title of the pull request. Changes by create-pull-request action
+body The body of the pull request. Automated changes by create-pull-request GitHub action
+labels A comma or newline-separated list of labels.
+assignees A comma or newline-separated list of assignees (GitHub usernames).
+reviewers A comma or newline-separated list of reviewers (GitHub usernames) to request a review from.
+team-reviewers A comma or newline-separated list of GitHub teams to request a review from. Note that a repo scoped PAT may be required. See this issue.
+milestone The number of the milestone to associate this pull request with.
+draft Create a draft pull request. false
+Action outputs
+The pull request number and URL are available as step outputs. Note that in order to read the step outputs the action step must have an id.
+  - name: Create Pull Request
+    id: cpr
+    uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
+  - name: Check outputs
+    run: |
+      echo "Pull Request Number - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}"
+      echo "Pull Request URL - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-url }}"
+Action behaviour
+The default behaviour of the action is to create a pull request that will be continually updated with new changes until it is merged or closed. Changes are committed and pushed to a fixed-name branch, the name of which can be configured with the branch input. Any subsequent changes will be committed to the same branch and reflected in the open pull request.
+How the action behaves:
+If there are changes (i.e. a diff exists with the checked-out base branch), the changes will be pushed to a new branch and a pull request created.
+If there are no changes (i.e. no diff exists with the checked-out base branch), no pull request will be created and the action exits silently.
+If a pull request already exists and there are no further changes (i.e. no diff with the current pull request branch) then the action exits silently.
+If a pull request exists and new changes on the base branch make the pull request unnecessary (i.e. there is no longer a diff between the pull request branch and the base), the pull request is automatically closed. Additionally, if delete-branch is set to true the branch will be deleted.
+For further details about how the action works and usage guidelines, see Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage.
+Alternative strategy - Always create a new pull request branch
+For some use cases it may be desirable to always create a new unique branch each time there are changes to be committed. This strategy is not recommended because if not used carefully it could result in multiple pull requests being created unnecessarily. If in doubt, use the default strategy of creating an updating a fixed-name branch.
+To use this strategy, set input branch-suffix with one of the following options.
+random - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with a random alpha-numeric string. e.g. create-pull-request/patch-6qj97jr, create-pull-request/patch-5jrjhvd
+timestamp - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed by a timestamp. e.g. create-pull-request/patch-1569322532, create-pull-request/patch-1569322552
+short-commit-hash - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with the short SHA1 commit hash. e.g. create-pull-request/patch-fcdfb59, create-pull-request/patch-394710b
+Controlling commits
+As well as relying on the action to handle uncommitted changes, you can additionally make your own commits before the action runs. Note that the repository must be checked out on a branch with a remote, it won't work for events which checkout a commit.
+steps:
+  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
+  - name: Create commits
+    run: |
+      git config user.name 'Peter Evans'
+      git config user.email 'peter-evans@users.noreply.github.com'
+      date +%s > report.txt
+      git commit -am "Modify tracked file during workflow"
+      date +%s > new-report.txt
+      git add -A
+      git commit -m "Add untracked file during workflow"
+  - name: Uncommitted change
+    run: date +%s > report.txt
+  - name: Create Pull Request
+    uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
+Ignoring files
+If there are files or directories you want to ignore you can simply add them to a .gitignore file at the root of your repository. The action will respect this file.
+Create a project card
+To create a project card for the pull request, pass the pull-request-number step output to create-or-update-project-card action.
+  - name: Create Pull Request
+    id: cpr
+    uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
+name: Create or Update Project Card
+uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card@v1
+with:
+project-name: My project
+column-name: My column
+issue-number: ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}
+Reference Example
+The following workflow sets many of the action's inputs for reference purposes. Check the defaults to avoid setting inputs unnecessarily.
+See examples for more realistic use cases.

+Standard +Consider Selling Price +Fair Value Uncertainty +Economic Moat +Stewardship Grade +03-11-2022 1 by Greggory Warren +Business Strategy & Outlook 03-11-2022 +While 2020 was an extremely difficult year for Berkshire Hathaway, with a nearly 10% decline in operating earnings and a more than 40% decline in reported net earnings, the firm's overall positioning improved as the back half of the year progressed. The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing its cash hoard through stock and bond investments and share repurchases.

+The operation.
+
+The possible values are:
+
+add. Depending on the target location reference, completes one of these functions:
+The target location is an array index. Inserts a new value into the array at the specified index.
+The target location is an object parameter that does not already exist. Adds a new parameter to the object.
+The target location is an object parameter that does exist. Replaces that parameter's value.
+The value parameter defines the value to add. For more information, see 4.1. add.
+remove. Removes the value at the target location. For the operation to succeed, the target location must exist. For more information, see 4.2. remove.
+replace. Replaces the value at the target location with a new value. The operation object must contain a value parameter that defines the replacement value. For the operation to succeed, the target location must exist. For more information, see 4.3. replace.
+value with . Removes the value at a specified location and adds it to the target location. The operation object must contain a from parameter, which is a string that contains a JSON pointer value that references the location in the target document from which to move the value. For the operation to succeed, the from location must exist. For more information, see 4.4. move.
+copy. Copies the value at a specified location to the target location. The operation object must contain a from parameter, which is a string that contains a JSON pointer value that references the location in the target document from which to copy the value. For the operation to succeed, the from location must exist. For more information, see 4.5. copy.
+test. Tests that a value at the target location is equal to a specified value. The operation object must contain a value parameter that defines the value to compare to the target location's value. For the operation to succeed, the target location must be equal to the value value. For test, equal indicates that the value at the target location and the value that value defines are of the same JSON type. The data type of the value determines how equality is defined:
+Type	Considered equal if both values
+strings	Contain the same number of Unicode characters and their code points are byte-by-byte equal.
+numbers	Are numerically equal.
+arrays	Contain the same number of values, and each value is equal to the value at the corresponding position in the other array, by using these type-specific rules.
+objects	Contain the same number of parameters, and each parameter is equal to a parameter in the other object, by comparing their keys (as strings) and their values (by using these type-specific rules).
+literals (false, true, and null)	Are the same. The comparison is a logical comparison. For example, whitespace between the parameter values of an array is not significant. Also, ordering of the serialization of object parameters is not significant.
+For more information, see 4.6. test.
+fromstring
+The JSON Pointer to the target document location from which to move the value. Required for the move operation.
+
+pathstring
+The JSON Pointer to the target document location at which to complete the operation.
+
+valuenumber,integer,string,boolean,null,array,object

+The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (â€œU.S. GAAPâ€). That presentation, which is referred to as â€œreportedâ€ basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firmâ€™s results that can be tracked
+consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firmâ€™s performance with other companiesâ€™ U.S. GAAP financial statements. In addition to analyzing the Firmâ€™s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a
+â€œmanagedâ€ basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. Refer to the notes on Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 28 for additional information on
+managed basis.
+The following summary table provides a reconciliation from reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

+deposits at Federal Reserve Banks that became effective in the second quarter of 2020. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 11-12 and Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 of the Firmâ€™s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the

+(a) On March 15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020. On
+December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain restrictions. As a result, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new
+common share repurchase program of $30 billion.
+(b) The net impact of employee issuances on stockholdersâ€™ equity is driven by the cost of equity compensation awards that is recognized over the applicable vesting periods. The cost is partially offset by tax impacts related to the distribution of shares and the exercise of employee
+stock options and SARs.

+(a) Client deposits and other third-party liabilities pertain to the Wholesale Payments and Securities Services businesses.
+(b) Represents total merchant processing volume across CIB, CCB and CB.
+
+(c) Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude positions related to the risk management of interest rate exposure from changes in the Firmâ€™s own credit spread on fair value option elected liabilities, and included these positions in other sensitivity-
+based measures. Additionally, effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence
+
+of these refinements, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $33 million, $15 million, $(11) million and $4 million, CIB Trading VaR of $30 million, $11 million, $(11) million and $5
+million and CIB VaR of $29 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.
+(d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA. Refer to VaR measurement on pages 121â€“123 of the Firmâ€™s 2019 Form 10-K, and pages 80â€“82
+of the Firmâ€™s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2020 for further information.
+(e) Average portfolio VaR was less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.
+(f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.

The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing its cash hoard through stock and bond investments and share repurchases.

+Employee Information Pay to the order of ZACHRY T WOOD
+Ultraviolet Overprinting Pattern
+A protective ultraviolet pattern, invisible to the
+naked eye, consisting of four lines of “FMS” or
+"FISCALSERVICE” bracketed by the “Fiscal
+Service” or “Financial Management Service”
+seal on the left and United States Seal (eagle)
+on the right. This pattern can usually be found
+under the payee information and dollar amount
+area. The FISCAL SERVICE pattern and seals
+can be detected under a black light. If the
+amount box is shaved or altered in any way, a
+space will be created in the ultraviolet area.
+When exposed to black light, the ink used in
+the pattern and the seal will glow. This
+fluorescent quality cannot be photocopied.
+Treasury Seal
+The seal identifies the “Bureau of the Fiscal Service” or
+"Financial Management Service." The previous seal
+reflecting “Financial Management Service” will be seen
+in rotation until this check stock runs out.
+Bleeding Ink
+The Treasury seal, located to the right of the Statue of
+Liberty, contains security ink that will run and turn red
+when moisture is applied to the black ink of the seal.
+Microprinting
+Microprinted words are so small they appear as just a
+line to the naked eye. However, when magnified, they
+become visible. Microprinting cannot be duplicated by a
+copier and when a check is counterfeited, it will often
+show up as a solid line or a series of dots. The U.S.
+Treasury check has three areas where microprinting is
+used.
+Watermark
+All U.S. Treasury checks are printed on
+watermarked paper. The watermark
+reads “U.S. TREASURY” and can be
+seen from both the front and back of the
+check when held up to a light. The
+watermark is light and cannot be
+reproduced by a copier. Any check not
+having the watermark should be
+suspected as being counterfeit or copied.
+You may verify check issue information using the Bureau of the Fiscal Service Treasury Check Verification System (TCVS) at: https://tcvs.fiscal.treasury.gov

+- 📫 How to reach me # npm Documentation
+
+[![Publish](https://github.com/npm/documentation/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/npm/documentation/actions/workflows/publish.yml)
+
+This is the documentation for
+[https://docs.npmjs.com/](https://docs.npmjs.com/).
+
+[This repository](https://github.com/npm/documentation) contains the
+content for our documentation site, and the GitHub Actions workflows
+that generate the site itself.
+
+## Quick start
+
+1. `npm install` to download gatsby, our theme, and the dependencies
+2. `npm run develop`: starts the test server at `http://localhost:8000`.
+3. Update the content - it's Mdx, which is like markdown - in the `content`
+   directory.
+4. Review your content at `http://localhost:8000`.  (Gatsby watches the
+   filesystem and will reload your content changes immediately.)
+5. Once you're happy, commit it and open a pull request at
+   https://github.com/npm/documentation.
+6. A CI workflow run will publish your PR to a GitHub Preview Page.
+7. Once the content is reviewed, merge the pull request.  That will
+   [deploy the site](https://github.com/npm/documentation/actions/workflows/publish.yml).
+
+Do you want to know more? Check out our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
+
+## Theme
+
+The gatsby theme used here is "[doctornpm](https://github.com/npm/doctornpm)" - a variation of
+[doctocat](https://github.com/primer/doctocat) with some theme changes
+for npm's design language and additional components to support multiple
+versions of the CLI documentation.
+

+
+If you want to create a new branch for your pull request and do not have write permissions to the repository, you can fork the repository first. For more information, see "[Creating a pull request from a fork](/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)" and "[About forks](/articles/about-forks)."
+
+You can specify which branch you'd like to merge your changes into when you create your pull request. Pull requests can only be opened between two branches that are different.
+
+{% data reusables.pull_requests.perms-to-open-pull-request %}
+
+{% data reusables.pull_requests.close-issues-using-keywords %}
+
+## Changing the branch range and destination repository
+
+By default, pull requests are based on the parent repository's default branch. For more information, see "[About branches](/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches#about-the-default-branch)."
+
+If the default parent repository isn't correct, you can change both the parent repository and the branch with the drop-down lists. You can also swap your head and base branches with the drop-down lists to establish diffs between reference points. References here must be branch names in your GitHub repository.
+
+![Pull Request editing branches](/assets/images/help/pull_requests/pull-request-review-edit-branch.png)
+
+When thinking about branches, remember that the *base branch* is **where** changes should be applied, the *head branch* contains **what** you would like to be applied.
+
+When you change the base repository, you also change notifications for the pull request. Everyone that can push to the base repository will receive an email notification and see the new pull request in their dashboard the next time they sign in.
+
+When you change any of the information in the branch range, the Commit and Files changed preview areas will update to show your new range.
+
+{% tip %}
+
+**Tips**:
+
+- Using the compare view, you can set up comparisons across any timeframe. For more information, see "[Comparing commits](/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/viewing-and-comparing-commits/comparing-commits)."
+
+- Project maintainers can add a pull request template for a repository. Templates include prompts for information in the body of a pull request. For more information, see "[About issue and pull request templates](/articles/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates)."
+
+{% endtip %}
+
+## Creating the pull request
+
+{% webui %}

+  ![Branch dropdown menu](/assets/images/help/pull_requests/branch-dropdown.png)
+
+{% data reusables.repositories.new-pull-request %}
+
+4. Use the _base_ branch dropdown menu to select the branch you'd like to merge your changes into, then use the _compare_ branch drop-down menu to choose the topic branch you made your changes in.

+{% data reusables.repositories.asking-for-review %}
+
+After your pull request has been reviewed, it can be [merged into the repository](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request).
+
+{% endwebui %}

+
+To create a pull request, use the `gh pr create` subcommand.
+
+```shell
+
+gh pr create
+
+```
+
+To assign a pull request to an individual, use the `--assignee` or `-a` flags. You can use `@me` to self-assign the pull request.
+
+```shell
+
+gh pr create --assignee "@octocat"
+
+```
+
+To specify the branch into which you want the pull request merged, use the `--base` or `-B` flags. To specify the branch that contains commits for your pull request, use the `--head` or `-H` flags.
+
+```shell
+
+gh pr create --base my-base-branch --head my-changed-branch
+
+```
+
+To include a title and body for the new pull request, use the `--title` and `--body` flags.
+
+```shell
+
+gh pr create --title "The bug is fixed" --body "Everything works again"
+
+```
+
+To mark a pull request as a draft, use the `--draft` flag.
+
+```shell
+
+gh pr create --draft
+
+```
+
+To add a labels or milestones to the new pull request, use the `--label` and `--milestone`  flags.
+
+```shell
+
+gh pr create --label "bug,help wanted" --milestone octocat-milestone
+
+```
+
+To add the new pull request to a specific project, use the `--project` flag.
+
+```shell
+
+gh pr create --project octocat-project
+
+```
+
+To assign an individual or team as reviewers, use the `--reviewer` flag.
+
+```shell
+
+gh pr create --reviewer monalisa,hubot  --reviewer myorg/team-name
+
+```
+
+To create the pull request in your default web browser, use the `--web` flag.
+
+```shell
+
+gh pr create --web
+
+```

This page details Docker's production release lifecycle and how Docker defines each stage. It also provides information on the product retirement process. 

## Lifecycle stage

| Lifecycle stage  | Customer availability | Support availability | Retirement |
| --- | --- | --- | ---|
| Customer zero | Internal Docker | Internal Docker | Can be discontinued without notice|
|Beta | All or select customers | Community support | Can be discontinued without notice |
| Early Access (EA) | All or select customers | Full | Follows retirement process |
| General Availability | All | Full | Follow retirement process |

## Retirement process 

The decision to retire or deprecate features follows a rigorous process including understanding the demand, use, impact of feature retirement and, most importantly, customer feedback. Our goal is to invest resources in areas that will add the most value for the most customers

Docker is committed to being clear, transparent, and proactive when interacting with our customers, especially about changes to our platform. To that end, we will make best efforts to follow these guidelines when retiring functionality:

Advance notice For minor changes resulting in retirement or deprecation of functionality, we will attempt to proactively notify customers at least 1 month in advance. For retirement of major features or products, we will attempt to notify customers at least 6 months in advance.
Viable alternatives Docker will strive to provide viable alternatives to our customers when retiring functionality. These may be alternative offerings from Docker or recommended alternatives from 3rd party providers. Where possible and appropriate, Docker will automatically migrate customers to alternatives for retired functionality.
Continued support Docker commits to providing continued support for functionality until its retirement date.

We may need to accelerate the timeline for retirement of functionality in extenuating circumstances, such as essential changes necessary to protect the integrity of our platform or the security of our customers and others. In these cases, it is important that those changes occur as quickly as possible.

Similarly, integrated third party software or services may need to be retired due to the third-party decision to change or retire their solution. In these situations, the pace of the retirement will be out of our control.

However, even under these circumstances, we will provide as much advance notice as possible.

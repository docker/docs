# Use the `/go/` URL prefix to provide "vanity" URLs linking to the
# documentation. These URLs can be used in (for example) the `docker` CLI to
# provide a short, permanent link to refer to a topic in the documentation.
# For example, the docker CLI can output https://docs.docker.com/go/some-topic
# in its help output, which can be redirected to elsewhere in the documentation.

# Code Scanning Workflows

GitHub code scanning is a developer-first, GitHub-native approach to easily find security vulnerabilities before they reach production. Before you can configure code scanning for a repository, you must enable code scanning by adding a GitHub Actions workflow to the repository. For more information, see [Setting up code scanning for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secure-coding/setting-up-code-scanning-for-a-repository).

        title = "What is a maintainer?"

        text = """
There are different types of maintainers, with different responsibilities, but
all maintainers have 3 things in common:

1) They share responsibility in the project's success.
2) They have made a long-term, recurring time investment to improve the project.
3) They spend that time doing whatever needs to be done, not necessarily what
is the most interesting or fun.

Maintainers are often under-appreciated, because their work is harder to appreciate.
It's easy to appreciate a really cool and technically advanced feature. It's harder
to appreciate the absence of bugs, the slow but steady improvement in stability,
or the reliability of a release process. But those things distinguish a good
project from a great one.
"""
    [Rules.adding-maintainers]

        title = "How are maintainers added?"

        text = """
Maintainers are first and foremost contributors that have shown they are
committed to the long term success of a project. Contributors wanting to
become maintainers are expected to be deeply involved in contributing code,
pull request review, and triage of issues in the project for more than three
months.

Just contributing does not make you a maintainer, it is about building trust
with the current maintainers of the project and being a person that they can
depend on and trust to make decisions in the best interest of the project.

Maintainers are assigned per project (repository). Being a maintainer in
one project does not automatically make you a maintainer in other projects.

Periodically, the existing maintainers curate a list of contributors that have
shown regular activity on the project over the prior months. From this
list, maintainer candidates are selected and proposed on the maintainers
mailing list.

After a candidate has been announced on the maintainers mailing list, the
existing maintainers are given five business days to discuss the candidate,
raise objections and cast their vote. Candidates must be approved by the BDFL
and at least 66% of the current maintainers by adding their vote on the mailing
list. Only maintainers of the repository that the candidate is proposed for are
allowed to vote. The BDFL's vote is mandatory.

If a candidate is approved, a maintainer will contact the candidate to
invite the candidate to open a pull request that adds the contributor to
the MAINTAINERS file. The candidate becomes a maintainer once the pull
request is merged.

        text = """
Life priorities, interests, and passions can change. If you're a maintainer but
feel you must remove yourself from the list, inform other maintainers that you
intend to step down, and if possible, help find someone to pick up your work.
At the very least, ensure your work can be continued where you left off.

After you've informed other maintainers, create a pull request to remove
yourself from the MAINTAINERS file.

        text = """
Similar to the procedure for adding new maintainers, existing maintainers can
be removed from the list if they do not show significant activity on the
project. Periodically, the maintainers review the list of maintainers and their
activity over the last three months.

If a maintainer has shown insufficient activity over this period, a neutral
person will contact the maintainer to ask if they want to continue being
a maintainer. If the maintainer decides to step down as a maintainer, they
open a pull request to be removed from the MAINTAINERS file.

If the maintainer wants to remain a maintainer, but is unable to perform the
required duties they can be removed with a vote by the BDFL and at least 66% of
the current maintainers. The BDFL's vote is mandatory. An e-mail is sent to the
mailing list, inviting maintainers of the project to vote. The voting period is
five business days. Issues related to a maintainer's performance should be
discussed with them among the other maintainers so that they are not surprised
by a pull request removing them.

Projects can opt to keep a list of former maintainers in the MAINTAINERS file.
Instead of removing a maintainer from the file when they step down, the maintainer
is moved to the alumni list (`[Org.Alumni]`). People on this list have
no official capacity in the project, it's a way to say "thank you" for the
work they have done for the project.

        text = """
Docker follows the timeless, highly efficient and totally unfair system
known as [Benevolent dictator for
life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Dictator_for_Life), with
yours truly, Solomon Hykes, in the role of BDFL. This means that all
decisions are made, by default, by Solomon. Since making every decision
myself would be highly un-scalable, in practice decisions are spread
across multiple maintainers.

Ideally, the BDFL role is like the Queen of England: awesome crown, but not
an actual operational role day-to-day. The real job of a BDFL is to NEVER GO AWAY.
Every other rule can change, perhaps drastically so, but the BDFL will always
be there, preserving the philosophy and principles of the project, and keeping
ultimate authority over its fate. This gives us great flexibility in experimenting
with various governance models, knowing that we can always press the "reset" button
without fear of fragmentation or deadlock. See the US congress for a counter-example.

BDFL daily routine:

* Is the project governance stuck in a deadlock or irreversibly fragmented?
    * If yes: refactor the project governance
* Are there issues or conflicts escalated by core?
    * If yes: resolve them
* Go back to polishing that crown.
"""

    [Rules.decisions]

        title = "How are decisions made?"

        text = """
Short answer: EVERYTHING IS A PULL REQUEST.

Docker is an open-source project with an open design philosophy. This
means that the repository is the source of truth for EVERY aspect of the
project, including its philosophy, design, road map, and APIs. *If it's
part of the project, it's in the repo. If it's in the repo, it's part of
the project.*

As a result, all decisions can be expressed as changes to the
repository. An implementation change is a change to the source code. An
API change is a change to the API specification. A philosophy change is
a change to the philosophy manifesto, and so on.

All decisions affecting Docker, big and small, follow the same 3 steps:

* Step 1: Open a pull request. Anyone can do this.

* Step 2: Discuss the pull request. Anyone can do this.

* Step 3: Merge or refuse the pull request. Who does this depends on the nature
of the pull request and which areas of the project it affects. See *review flow*
for details.

Because Docker is such a large and active project, it's important for everyone to know
who is responsible for deciding what. That is determined by a precise set of rules.

* For every *decision* in the project, the rules should designate, in a deterministic way,
who should *decide*.

* For every *problem* in the project, the rules should designate, in a deterministic way,
who should be responsible for *fixing* it.

* For every *question* in the project, the rules should designate, in a deterministic way,
who should be expected to have the *answer*.
"""

    [Rules.review]

        title = "Review flow"

        text = """
Pull requests should be processed according to the following flow:

* For each subsystem affected by the change, the maintainers of the subsystem must approve or refuse it.
It is the responsibility of the subsystem maintainers to process patches affecting them in a timely
manner.

* If the change affects areas of the code which are not part of a subsystem,
or if subsystem maintainers are unable to reach a timely decision, it must be approved by
the core maintainers.

* If the change affects the UI or public APIs, or if it represents a major change in architecture,
the architects must approve or refuse it.

* If the change affects the operations of the project, it must be approved or rejected by
the relevant operators.

* If the change affects the governance, philosophy, goals or principles of the project,
it must be approved by BDFL.

    text = """
The [DCO or `Sign your work`](
https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-your-work)
requirement is not intended as a roadblock or speed bump.

Some Docker contributors are not as familiar with `git`, or have used a web based
editor, and thus asking them to `git commit --amend -s` is not the best way forward.

In this case, maintainers can update the commits based on clause (c) of the DCO. The
most trivial way for a contributor to allow the maintainer to do this, is to add
a DCO signature in a pull requests's comment, or a maintainer can simply note that
the change is sufficiently trivial that it does not substantially change the existing
contribution - i.e., a spelling change.

When you add someone's DCO, please also add your own to keep a log.

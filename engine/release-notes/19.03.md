## 19.03.11
2020-06-01

### Network

Disable IPv6 Router Advertisements to prevent address spoofing. [CVE-2020-13401](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-13401)

**Description**

In the Docker default configuration, the container network interface is a virtual ethernet link going to the host (veth interface).
In this configuration, an attacker able to run a process as root in a container can send and receive arbitrary packets to the host using the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability (present in the default configuration).

If IPv6 is not totally disabled on the host (via `ipv6.disable=1` on the kernel cmdline), it will be either unconfigured or configured on some interfaces, but it’s pretty likely that ipv6 forwarding is disabled, that is, `/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//forwarding == 0`. Also by default, `/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//accept_ra == 1`. The combination of these 2 sysctls means that the host accepts router advertisements and configures the IPv6 stack using them.

By sending “rogue” router advertisements from a container, an attacker can reconfigure the host to redirect part or all of the IPv6 traffic of the host to the attacker-controlled container.

Even if there was no IPv6 traffic before, if the DNS returns A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records, many HTTP libraries will try to connect via IPv6 first then fallback to IPv4, giving an opportunity to the attacker to respond.
If by chance the host has a vulnerability like last year’s RCE in apt (CVE-2019-3462), the attacker can now escalate to the host.

As `CAP_NET_ADMIN` is not present by default for Docker containers, the attacker can’t configure the IPs they want to MitM, they can’t use iptables to NAT or REDIRECT the traffic, and they can’t use `IP_TRANSPARENT`.
The attacker can however still use `CAP_NET_RAW` and implement a tcp/ip stack in user space.

See [kubernetes/kubernetes#91507](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/91507) for related issues.

* In some circumstances with large clusters, Docker information might, as part of the Swarm section,
  include the error `code = ResourceExhausted desc = grpc: received message larger than
  max (5351376 vs. 4194304)`. This does not indicate any failure or misconfiguration by the user,
  and requires no response.
* Orchestrator port conflict can occur when redeploying all services as new. Due to many Swarm manager
  requests in a short amount of time, some services are not able to receive traffic and are causing a `404`
  error after being deployed.
     - **Workaround:** restart all tasks via `docker service update --force`.
* [CVE-2018-15664](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15664) symlink-exchange attack with directory traversal. Workaround until proper fix is available in upcoming patch release: `docker pause` container before doing file operations. [moby/moby#39252](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/39252)
* `docker cp` regression due to CVE mitigation. An error is produced when the source of `docker cp` is set to `/`.

### Known Issues

#### New

* `DOCKER-USER` iptables chain is missing: [docker/for-linux#810](https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/810).
  Users cannot perform additional container network traffic filtering on top of
  this iptables chain. You are not affected by this issue if you are not
  customizing iptable chains on top of `DOCKER-USER`.
     - **Workaround:** Insert the iptables chain after the docker daemon starts.
       For example:
       ```
       iptables -N DOCKER-USER
       iptables -I FORWARD -j DOCKER-USER
       iptables -A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN
       ```

#### Existing

  error after being deployed.
     - Workaround: restart all tasks via `docker service update --force`.

* Traffic cannot egress the HOST because of missing Iptables rules in the FORWARD chain
  The missing rules are :
     ```
     /sbin/iptables --wait -C FORWARD -o docker_gwbridge -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
     /sbin/iptables --wait -C FORWARD -o docker0 -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
     ```
     - Workaround: Add these rules back using a script and cron definitions. The script
     must contain '-C' commands to check for the presence of a rule and '-A' commands to add
     rules back. Run the script on a cron in regular intervals, for example, every <x> minutes.
     - Affected versions: 18.09.1, 19.03.0
* [CVE-2018-15664](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15664) symlink-exchange attack with directory traversal. Workaround until proper fix is available in upcoming patch release: `docker pause` container before doing file operations. [moby/moby#39252](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/39252)

### Security

 * Fixed loading of nsswitch based config inside chroot under Glibc. [CVE-2019-14271](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14271)

### Known issues

 * In some circumstances, in large clusters, docker information might, as part of the Swarm section,
 include the error `code = ResourceExhausted desc = grpc: received message larger than
 max (5351376 vs. 4194304)`. This does not indicate any failure or misconfiguration by the user,
 and requires no response.
 * Orchestrator port conflict can occur when redeploying all services as new. Due to many swarm manager
 requests in a short amount of time, some services are not able to receive traffic and are causing a `404`
 error after being deployed.
    - Workaround: restart all tasks via `docker service update --force`.

 * Traffic cannot egress the HOST because of missing Iptables rules in the FORWARD chain
 The missing rules are :
     ```

     /sbin/iptables --wait -C FORWARD -o docker0 -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

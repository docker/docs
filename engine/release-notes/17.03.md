## 17.03.0-ce
2017-03-01

**IMPORTANT**: Starting with this release, Docker is on a monthly release cycle and uses a
new YY.MM versioning scheme to reflect this. Two channels are available: monthly and quarterly.
Any given monthly release will only receive security and bugfixes until the next monthly
release is available. Quarterly releases receive security and bugfixes for 4 months after
initial release. This release includes bugfixes for 1.13.1 but
there are no major feature additions and the API version stays the same.
Upgrading from Docker 1.13.1 to 17.03.0 is expected to be simple and low-risk.

* Block obsolete socket families in default seccomp profile - mitigates unpatched kernels' CVE-2017-6074 [#29076](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/29076)

### Networking

* Fix bug on overlay encryption keys rotation in cross-datacenter swarm [#30727](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/30727)
* Fix side effect panic in overlay encryption and network control plane communication failure ("No installed keys could decrypt the message") on frequent swarm leader re-election [#25608](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/25608)
* Several fixes around system responsiveness and datapath programming when using overlay network with external kv-store [docker/libnetwork#1639](https://github.com/docker/libnetwork/pull/1639), [docker/libnetwork#1632](https://github.com/docker/libnetwork/pull/1632) and more...
* Discard incoming plain vxlan packets for encrypted overlay network [#31170](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/31170)

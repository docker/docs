> With this release, the daemon, client and container runtime are now all shipped
> in separate packages. When updating, you need to update all packages at the same
> time to get the latest patch releases for each. For example, on Ubuntu:
> 
> ```console
> $ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
> ```

## 18.09.1

2019-01-09

#### Important notes about this release

In Docker versions prior to 18.09, containerd was managed by the Docker engine daemon. In Docker Engine 18.09, containerd is managed by systemd. Since containerd is managed by systemd, any custom configuration to the `docker.service` systemd configuration which changes mount settings (for example, `MountFlags=slave`) breaks interactions between the Docker Engine daemon and containerd, and you will not be able to start containers.

Run the following command to get the current value of the `MountFlags` property for the `docker.service`:

```console
$ sudo systemctl show --property=MountFlags docker.service
MountFlags=
```

Update your configuration if this command prints a non-empty value for `MountFlags`, and restart the docker service.

### Security fixes
* Upgraded Go language to 1.10.6 to resolve [CVE-2018-16873](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16873), [CVE-2018-16874](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16874), and [CVE-2018-16875](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16875).
* Fixed authz plugin for 0-length content and path validation.
* Added `/proc/asound` to masked paths [docker/engine#126](https://github.com/docker/engine/pull/126)

### Improvements
* Updated to BuildKit 0.3.3 [docker/engine#122](https://github.com/docker/engine/pull/122)
* Updated to containerd 1.2.2 [docker/engine#144](https://github.com/docker/engine/pull/144)
* Provided additional warnings for use of deprecated legacy overlay and devicemapper storage drivers [docker/engine#85](https://github.com/docker/engine/pull/85)
* prune: perform image pruning before build cache pruning [docker/cli#1532](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/1532)
* Added bash completion for experimental CLI commands (manifest) [docker/cli#1542](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/1542)
* Windows: allow process isolation on Windows 10 [docker/engine#81](https://github.com/docker/engine/pull/81)

### Fixes
* Disable kmem accounting in runc on RHEL/CentOS (docker/escalation#614, docker/escalation#692) [docker/engine#121](https://github.com/docker/engine/pull/121)

* API: ignore default address-pools on API < 1.39 [docker/engine#118](https://github.com/docker/engine/pull/118)
* API: add missing default address pool fields to swagger [docker/engine#119](https://github.com/docker/engine/pull/119)
* awslogs: account for UTF-8 normalization in limits [docker/engine#112](https://github.com/docker/engine/pull/112)

* There are important changes to the upgrade process that, if not correctly followed, can have impact on the availability of applications running on the Swarm during upgrades. These constraints impact any upgrades coming from any version before 18.09 to version 18.09 or greater.

## 18.09.0

### Important notes about this release

In Docker versions prior to 18.09, containerd was managed by the Docker engine daemon. In Docker Engine 18.09, containerd is managed by systemd. Since containerd is managed by systemd, any custom configuration to the `docker.service` systemd

### Known Issues

* There are important changes to the upgrade process that, if not correctly followed, can have impact on the availability of applications running on the Swarm during upgrades. These constraints impact any upgrades coming from any version before 18.09 to version 18.09 or greater.
* With https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/releases/download/v18.09.0/boot2docker.iso, connection is being refused from a node on the virtual machine. Any publishing of swarm ports in virtualbox-created docker-machine VM's will not respond. This is occurring on macOS and Windows 10, using docker-machine version 0.15 and 0.16.

   The following `docker run` command works, allowing access from host browser:

   `docker run -d -p 4000:80 nginx`

   However, the following `docker service` command fails, resulting in curl/chrome unable to connect (connection refused):

   `docker service create -p 5000:80 nginx`

   This issue is not apparent when provisioning 18.09.0 cloud VM's using docker-machine.

   Workarounds:
   * Use cloud VM's that don't rely on boot2docker.
   * `docker run` is unaffected.
   * For Swarm, set VIRTUALBOX_BOOT2DOCKER_URL=https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/releases/download/v18.06.1-ce/boot2docker.iso.

   This issue is resolved in 18.09.1.

### Deprecation Notices

- Docker has deprecated support for Device Mapper as a storage driver. It will continue to be
supported at this time, but support will be removed in a future release.

    The [Overlay2 storage driver](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver/) is now the default for Docker engine implementations.

For more information on the list of deprecated flags and APIs, have a look at the [deprecation information](https://docs.docker.com/engine/deprecated/) where you can find the target removal dates.

### End of Life Notification

In this release, Docker has also removed support for TLS < 1.2 [moby/moby#37660](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/37660),
Ubuntu 14.04 "Trusty Tahr" [docker-ce-packaging#255](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce-packaging/pull/255) / [docker-ce-packaging#254](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce-packaging/pull/254), and Debian 8 "Jessie" [docker-ce-packaging#255](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce-packaging/pull/255) / [docker-ce-packaging#254](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce-packaging/pull/254).

> **Note**
>
> From Docker Engine version 23.0.0, Buildx is distributed in a separate package: `docker-buildx-plugin`.
> In earlier versions, Buildx was included in the `docker-ce-cli` package.
> When you upgrade to this version of Docker Engine, make sure you update all
> packages. For example, on Ubuntu:
>
> ```console
> $ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
> ```
>
> Refer to the [Docker Engine installation instructions][1] for your operating system
> for more details on upgrading Docker Engine.

This page describes the latest changes, additions, known issues, and fixes for Docker Engine version 23.0.

For more information about:

- Deprecated and removed features, see [Deprecated Engine Features](../deprecated.md).
- Changes to the Engine API, see [Engine API version history](../api/version-history.md).

Starting with the 23.0.0 release, Docker Engine moves away from using CalVer versioning,
and starts using the [SemVer versioning format](https://semver.org/).
Changing the version format is a stepping-stone towards Go module compatibility,
but the repository doesn't yet use Go modules, and still requires using a "+incompatible" version.
Work continues towards Go module compatibility in a future release.

### Bug fixes and enhancements

- Fixed a number of issues that can cause Swarm encrypted overlay networks
  to fail to uphold their guarantees, addressing [CVE-2023-28841](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-28841),
  [CVE-2023-28840](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-28840), and
  [CVE-2023-28842](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-28842).
  - A lack of kernel support for encrypted overlay networks now reports
    as an error.

    multiple nodes to attach.
  - Encrypted overlay networks are now usable on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9
    through the use of the `xt_bpf` kernel module.
  - Users of Swarm overlay networks should review [GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw](https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw)
    to ensure that unintentional exposure has not occurred.

- Add a loading spinner to the `docker cp` command. [docker/cli#2708](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/2708)

- API: `GET /containers/{id}/logs` and `POST /containers/{id}/attach` now report which raw-stream format is in use using the `Content-type` response header on API version >= 1.42. [moby/moby#39812](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/39812)
- Set default sandbox size for Windows layers to 127GB, and ensure that the `--storage-opts` flag applies to all storage on Windows. [moby/moby#41636](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/41636)
- Remove the plugin section from the containerd configuration file (`/var/run/docker/containerd/containerd.toml`). [moby/moby#41675](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/41675)

### Known issues

#### apparmor_parser ([tracking issue](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/44900))

Some Debian users have reported issues with containers failing to start after upgrading to the 23.0 branch.
The error message indicates that the issue is due to a missing `apparmor_parser` binary:

```console
Error response from daemon: AppArmor enabled on system but the docker-default profile could not be loaded: running `apparmor_parser apparmor_parser --version` failed with output:
error: exec: "apparmor_parser": executable file not found in $PATH
Error: failed to start containers: somecontainer
```

The workaround to this issue is to install the `apparmor` package manually:

```console
apt-get install apparmor
```

#### BuildKit inline cache ([tracking issue](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/44918))

Attempting to build an image with BuildKit's inline cache feature (e.g. `docker build --build-arg BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1 .`, `docker buildx build --cache-to type=inline .`) will result in the daemon unexpectedly exiting:

```
panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
[signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x1 addr=0x18 pc=0x147ff00]

goroutine 693 [running]:
github.com/docker/docker/vendor/github.com/moby/buildkit/cache.computeBlobChain.func4.1({0x245cca8, 0x4001394960})

created by github.com/docker/docker/vendor/github.com/moby/buildkit/util/flightcontrol.(*call).wait
```

The daemon will restart if configured to do so (e.g. via systemd) after such a crash. The only available mitigation in this release is to avoid performing builds with the inline cache feature enabled.

#### BuildKit with warm cache ([tracking issue](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/44943))

If an image was built with BuildKit on a previous version of the daemon, and is built with a 23.0 daemon, previously cached layers will not be restored correctly. The image may appear to build correctly if no lines are changed in the Dockerfile; however, if partial cache invalidation occurs due to changing some lines in the Dockerfile, the still valid and previously cached layers will not be loaded correctly.

This most often presents as files that should be present in the image not being present in a `RUN` stage, or any other stage that references files, after changing some lines in the Dockerfile:

```

```

To mitigate this, the previous build cache must be discarded. `docker builder prune -a` will completely empty the build cache, and allow the affected builds to proceed again by removing the mishandled cache layers.

#### ipvlan networks ([tracking issue](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/44925))

When upgrading to the 23.0 branch, the existence of any [ipvlan](../../network/drivers/ipvlan.md) networks will prevent the daemon from starting:

```

To mitigate this, affected users can downgrade and remove the network, then upgrade again.
Alternatively, the entire network store can be removed, and networks can be recreated after the upgrade. The network store is located at `/var/lib/docker/network/files/local-kv.db`. If the daemon is using an alternate `--data-root`, substitute `/var/lib/docker` for the alternate path.

#### Kata Containers ([tracking issue](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/issues/6154))

The 23.0 branch brings support for alternate containerd shims, such as `io.containerd.runsc.v1` (gVisor) and `io.containerd.kata.v2` (Kata Containers).

When using the Kata Containers runtime, exiting an `exec` session stops the running container, and hangs the connected CLI if a TTY was opened. There is no mitigation at this time beyond avoiding execing into containers running on the Kata runtime.

The root cause of this issue is a long-standing bug in Moby. This will be resolved in a future release. Be advised that support for alternate OCI runtimes is a new feature and that similar issues may be discovered as more users start exercising this functionality.

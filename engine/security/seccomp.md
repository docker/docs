title: Seccomp security profiles for Docker
---

Secure computing mode (`seccomp`) is a Linux kernel feature. You can use it to
restrict the actions available within the container. The `seccomp()` system
call operates on the seccomp state of the calling process. You can use this
feature to restrict your application's access.

This feature is available only if Docker has been built with `seccomp` and the
kernel is configured with `CONFIG_SECCOMP` enabled. To check if your kernel
supports `seccomp`:

```console
$ grep CONFIG_SECCOMP= /boot/config-$(uname -r)
CONFIG_SECCOMP=y
```

## Pass a profile for a container

The default `seccomp` profile provides a sane default for running containers with
seccomp and disables around 44 system calls out of 300+. It is moderately
protective while providing wide application compatibility. The default Docker
profile can be found
[here](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/profiles/seccomp/default.json).

In effect, the profile is a allowlist which denies access to system calls by
default, then allowlists specific system calls. The profile works by defining a
`defaultAction` of `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO` and overriding that action only for specific
system calls. The effect of `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO` is to cause a `Permission Denied`
error. Next, the profile defines a specific list of system calls which are fully
allowed, because their `action` is overridden to be `SCMP_ACT_ALLOW`. Finally,
some specific rules are for individual system calls such as `personality`, and others, 
to allow variants of those system calls with specific arguments.

`seccomp` is instrumental for running Docker containers with least privilege. It
is not recommended to change the default `seccomp` profile.

When you run a container, it uses the default profile unless you override it
with the `--security-opt` option. For example, the following explicitly
specifies a policy:

```console
$ docker run --rm \
             -it \
             --security-opt seccomp=/path/to/seccomp/profile.json \
             hello-world
```

### Significant syscalls blocked by the default profile

Docker's default seccomp profile is an allowlist which specifies the calls that
are allowed. The table below lists the significant (but not all) syscalls that
are effectively blocked because they are not on the Allowlist. The table includes
the reason each syscall is blocked rather than white-listed.

| Syscall             | Description                                                                                                                           |

## Run without the default seccomp profile

You can pass `unconfined` to run a container without the default seccomp
profile.

```console
$ docker run --rm -it --security-opt seccomp=unconfined debian:jessie \
    unshare --map-root-user --user sh -c whoami
```

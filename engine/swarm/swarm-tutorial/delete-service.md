The remaining steps in the tutorial don't use the `helloworld` service, so now
you can delete the service from the swarm.

1.  If you haven't already, open a terminal and ssh into the machine where you
    run your manager node. For example, the tutorial uses a machine named
    `manager1`.

2.  Run `docker service rm helloworld` to remove the `helloworld` service.

    ```console
    $ docker service rm helloworld

    helloworld
    ```

3.  Run `docker service inspect <SERVICE-ID>` to verify that the swarm manager
    removed the service. The CLI returns a message that the service is not
    found:

    ```console
    $ docker service inspect helloworld
    []
    Error: no such service: helloworld
    ```

4.  Even though the service no longer exists, the task containers take a few
    seconds to clean up. You can use `docker ps` on the nodes to verify when the
    tasks have been removed.

    ```console
    $ docker ps

    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS     NAMES

    $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS     NAMES

    ```

## What's next?

In the next step of the tutorial, you set up a new service and apply a
[rolling update](rolling-update.md).

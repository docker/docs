Docker Scout's long-term vision is to provide features to help you maintain a
secure software supply chain. However, there are other tools and products that
promise to do the same, all of which might show different results to Docker
Scout. This document explains some of how Docker Scout works and how it compares to other tools.

Docker Scout creates and maintains it's vulnerability database by ingesting and collating vulnerability data regularly from multiple sources. These sources include many high-profile package repositories and security trackers, such as:

- [Alpine secdb](https://secdb.alpinelinux.org/)
- [Amazon Linux Security Center](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/)
- [CISA Known Exploited Vulnerability Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)
- [inTheWild, a community-driven open database of vulnerability exploitation](https://github.com/gmatuz/inthewilddb)
- [Debian Security Bug Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/)
- [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/)
- [RedHat Security Data](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/)
- [Ubuntu CVE Tracker](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/)
- [Oracle Linux Security](https://linux.oracle.com/security/)
- [SUSE Security CVRF](http://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/security/cvrf/)
- [RustSec Advisory Database](https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db)
- [Python Packaging Advisory Database](https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database)
- [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories/)
- [GitLab Advisory Database](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/advisories-community/)
- [Golang VulnDB](https://github.com/golang/vulndb)
- [Wolfi Security Feed](https://packages.wolfi.dev/os/security.json)

Scout correlates this data by making a full inventory of a container image and
storing that inventory in a software bill of materials (SBOM).

The SBOM summarizes the contents of the image and how the contents got there
meaning that when there is information about a new vulnerability, Docker Scout
correlates it with the SBOM. If Docker Scout finds a match for a vulnerability,
it can identify the artefact that's now vulnerable, why, and where it's in use.

When a customer enrols with Docker Scout, the organization receives their own instance of the database. This database tracks timestamped metadata about your images that Docker Scout can then match to CVEs. Find more details on how this works in the[Advanced image analysis document](./advanced-image-analysis.md).

Many other tools use fuzzy Common Product Enumeration (CPE) matching with wild cards to attempt to match potential vulnerabilities. This can return a lot of false positives which you need to triage.

For example, the typical structure of a CPE looks like this:

```
cpe:<cpe_version>:<part>:<vendor>:<product>:<version>:<update>:<edition>:<language>:<sw_edition>:<target_sw>:<target_hw>:<other>
```

For example `cpe:*:*:*:calendar:*:*:*:*:*:*:*` returns a match on anything with the product name "calendar" - of which there will be a lot!

Instead, Docker Scout matches CVEs to SBOMs using package URL (PURL) links that are a more precise, universal schema for matching software packages.

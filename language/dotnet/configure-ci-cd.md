## Get started with GitHub Actions

{% include gha-tutorial.md %}

## Next steps

In this module, you have learnt how to set up GitHub Actions workflow to an existing Docker project, optimize your workflow to improve build times and reduce the number of pull requests, and finally, we learnt how to push only specific versions to Docker Hub. You can also set up nightly tests against the latest tag, test each PR, or do something more elegant with the tags we are using and make use of the Git tag for the same tag in our image.

You can also consider deploying your application. For detailed instructions, see:

Sharing a Dev Environment lets your team members access the code, any dependencies, and the current Git branch you are working on. They can also review your changes and provide feedback before you create a pull request.

## Share your Dev Environment

When you are ready to share your environment, hover over your Dev Environment, select the **Share** icon, and specify the Docker Hub namespace where youâ€™d like to push your Dev Environment to.

This creates an image of your Dev Environment, uploads it to the Docker Hub namespace you have specified, and provides a tiny URL to share with your team members.

## Open a Dev Environment that has been shared with you

To open a Dev Environment that was shared with you, select the **Create** button in the top right-hand corner, select the **Existing Dev Environment** tab, and then paste the URL.

Using this shared Dev Environment, your team members can access the code, any dependencies, and the current Git branch you are working on. They can also review your changes and give feedback even before you create a pull request!

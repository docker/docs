The config file makes distributing your dev environment easy so everyone can access the same code and any dependencies.

### Distribute your dev environment

When you are ready to share your environment, simply copy the link to the Github repo where your project is stored, and share the link with your team members. 

### Open a dev environment that has been distributed to you

To open a dev environment that has been shared with you, select the **Create** button in the top right-hand corner, select the **New Dev Environment** tab, with source **Existing Git repo**, and then paste the URL.

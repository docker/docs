Sharing a Dev Environment lets your team members access the code, any dependencies, and the current Git branch you are working on. They can also review your changes and provide feedback before you create a pull request.

### Share your Dev Environment

When you are ready to share your environment, simply copy the link to the Github repo where your project is stored, and share the link with your team members. 

### Open a Dev Environment that has been shared with you

To open a Dev Environment that has been shared with you, select the **Create** button in the top right-hand corner, select the **Existing Dev Environment** tab, and then paste the URL.

Using this shared Dev Environment, your team members can access the code, any dependencies, and the current Git branch you are working on. They can also review your changes and provide feedback even before you create a pull request!

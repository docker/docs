The quickstart guide is a useful way of learning the basics of Dev Environments before geting into it more deeply.

## Step one: Preparation

Dev Environments is available as part of Docker Desktop 3.5.0 release. Download and install **Docker Desktop 3.5.0** or higher:

- [Docker Desktop](../release-notes.md)

To get started with Dev Environments, you must also install the following tools and extension on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}
- [Visual Studio Code Remote Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}

### Add Git to your PATH on Windows

If you have already installed Git, and it's not detected properly, run the following command to check whether you can use Git with the CLI or PowerShell:

`$ git --version`

If it doesn't detect Git as a valid command, you must reinstall Git and ensure you choose the option  **Git from the command line...** or the **Use Git and optional Unix tools...**  on the **Adjusting your PATH environment**  step.

> After Git is installed, restart Docker Desktop. Select **Quit Docker Desktop**, and then start it again.

## Step two: Explore the project information 

## Step three: Launch the sample project

From the Dev Environments tab in Docker Desktop, hover over the sample project and select the **Run** icon.

## QUICK Catchy benefits and what DEVENVs is

With Microsoft Dev Box, organizations can:

- Maximize dev productivity with ready-to-code, self-service Dev Boxes.
- Centralize governance of workstations running anywhere to maintain greater security, compliance, and cost efficiency.
- Customize dev boxes with everything developers need for their current projects.

Designed to work with most major languages, frameworks and services, Lando provides an easy way for developers of all skill levels to specify simple or complex requirements for their projects, and then quickly get to work on them.

## WHO IS IT FOR?
Martines need a self-service experience so you can run different dev environments for you teamas and when you need them. Helps you get set up and to your code faster 

Kevins can efficiently configure and assign dev environments which provide the right tools for the job - 

removes the onerous experience of onboarding team members. Standardizing your team's dev environments and tooling on OSX, Windows and Linuxs

### HOW DOES IT WORK?

Pwered by Docker Compose - This is why it is good it’s powered by Docker Compose and this is why it means it’s flexible 

On a high level, your compose.yaml configuration should contain ALL the things you need to run, develop and test your project. 

We've found a useful pattern here is for the senior-est, most DevOps-y person on your team to craft the initial lando configuration and be responsible for its maintenance but to generally "set it and forget it"

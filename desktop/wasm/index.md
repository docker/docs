Wasm (short for WebAssembly) is a fast, light alternative to the Linux and
Windows containers you’re using in Docker today (with
[some tradeoffs](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-wasm-technical-preview/){:target="_blank"
rel="noopener" class="_"}).

This page provides information about the new ability to run Wasm applications
alongside your Linux containers in Docker.

> **Beta**
>
> The Wasm feature is currently in [Beta](../../release-lifecycle.md/#beta).
> We recommend that you do not use this feature in production environments as
> this feature may change or be removed from future releases.

## Enable Wasm workloads

Wasm workloads require the [containerd image store](../containerd/index.md)
feature to be enabled. If you’re not already using the containerd image store,
then pre-existing images and containers will be inaccessible.

1. Open the Docker Desktop **Settings**.
2. Go to the **Features in development** tab.
3. Check the following checkboxes:
   - **Use containerd for storing and pulling images**
   - **Enable Wasm**
4. Select **Apply & restart** to save the settings.
5. In the confirmation dialog, select **Install** to install the Wasm runtimes.

Docker Desktop downloads and installs the following runtimes that you can use
to run Wasm workloads:

- `io.containerd.slight.v1`
- `io.containerd.spin.v1`
- `io.containerd.wasmedge.v1`
- `io.containerd.wasmtime.v1`

## Usage examples

### Running a Wasm application with `docker run`

The following `docker run` command starts a Wasm container on your system:

```console
$ docker run \
  --runtime=io.containerd.wasmedge.v1 \
  --platform=wasi/wasm \
  secondstate/rust-example-hello
```

After running this command, you can visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to see the "Hello world" output from this example module.

Note the `--runtime` and `--platform` flags used in this command:

- `--runtime=io.containerd.wasmedge.v1`: informs the Docker engine that you want
  to use the Wasm containerd shim instead of the standard Linux container
  runtime
- `--platform=wasi/wasm`: specifies the architecture of the image you want to
  use. By leveraging a Wasm architecture, you don’t need to build separate
  images for the different machine architectures. The Wasm runtime takes care of
  the final step of converting the Wasm binary to machine instructions.

### Running a Wasm application with Docker Compose

The same application can be run using the following Docker Compose file:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: secondstate/rust-example-hello
    platform: wasi/wasm
    runtime: io.containerd.wasmedge.v1
```

Start the application using the normal Docker Compose commands:

```console
$ docker compose up
```

### Running a multi-service application with Wasm

Networking works the same as you expect with Linux containers, giving you the
flexibility to combine Wasm applications with other containerized workloads,
such as a database, in a single application stack.

In the following example, the Wasm application leverages a MariaDB database
running in a container.

1. Clone the repository.

   ```console
   $ git clone https://github.com/second-state/microservice-rust-mysql.git
   Cloning into 'microservice-rust-mysql'...
   remote: Enumerating objects: 75, done.
   remote: Counting objects: 100% (75/75), done.
   remote: Compressing objects: 100% (42/42), done.
   remote: Total 75 (delta 29), reused 48 (delta 14), pack-reused 0
   Receiving objects: 100% (75/75), 19.09 KiB | 1.74 MiB/s, done.
   Resolving deltas: 100% (29/29), done.
   ```

2. Navigate into the cloned project and start the project using Docker Compose.

   ```console
   $ cd microservice-rust-mysql
   $ docker compose up
   [+] Running 0/1
   ⠿ server Warning                                                                                                  0.4s

   ```

   If you run `docker image ls` from another terminal window, you can see the
   Wasm image in your image store.

   ```console
   $ docker image ls
   REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
   server       latest    2c798ddecfa1   2 minutes ago   3MB
   ```

   Inspecting the image shows the image has a `wasi/wasm` platform, a
   combination of OS and architecture:

   ```console
   $ docker image inspect server | grep -A 3 "Architecture"
           "Architecture": "wasm",
           "Os": "wasi",
           "Size": 3001146,
           "VirtualSize": 3001146,
   ```

3. Open the URL `http://localhost:8090` in a browser and create a few sample
   orders. All of these are interacting with the Wasm server.

4. When you're all done, tear everything down by hitting `Ctrl+C` in the
   terminal you launched the application.

### Building and pushing a Wasm module

1. Create a Dockerfile that builds your Wasm application.

   Exactly how to do this varies depending on the programming language you use.

2. In a separate stage in your `Dockerfile`, extract the module and set it as
   the `ENTRYPOINT`.

   ```dockerfile
   # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
   FROM scratch
   COPY --from=build /build/hello_world.wasm /hello_world.wasm
   ENTRYPOINT [ "/hello_world.wasm" ]
   ```

3. Build and push the image specifying the `wasi/wasm` architecture. Buildx
   makes this easy to do in a single command.

   ```console
   $ docker buildx build --platform wasi/wasm -t username/hello-world .
   ...
   => exporting to image                                                                             0.0s
   => => exporting layers                                                                            0.0s

   ```

## Troubleshooting

This section contains instructions on how to resolve common issues.

### Unknown runtime specified

If you try to run a Wasm container before you have opted in to use the
containerd image store, an error similar to the following displays:

```
docker: Error response from daemon: Unknown runtime specified io.containerd.wasmedge.v1.
```

[Turn on the containerd feature](../containerd/index.md#enabling-the-containerd-image-store-feature)
in Docker Desktop settings and try again.

### Failed to start shim: failed to resolve runtime path

If you use an older version of Docker Desktop that doesn't support running Wasm
workloads, you will see an error message similar to the following:

```
docker: Error response from daemon: failed to start shim: failed to resolve runtime path: runtime "io.containerd.wasmedge.v1" binary not installed "containerd-shim-wasmedge-v1": file does not exist: unknown.
```

Update your Docker Desktop to the latest version and try again.

## Known issues

- Docker Compose may not exit cleanly when interrupted
  - Workaround: Clean up `docker-compose` processes by sending them a SIGKILL
    (`killall -9 docker-compose`).
- Pushes to Hub might give an error stating
  `server message: insufficient_scope: authorization failed`, even after logging
  in using Docker Desktop
  - Workaround: Run `docker login` in the CLI

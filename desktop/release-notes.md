### New

- [Compose v2.5.1](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/v2.5.1)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Fixed an issue with manual proxy settings which caused problems when pulling images. Fixes [docker/for-win#12714](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12714) and [docker/for-mac#6315](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6315).
- Fixed high CPU usage when extensions are disabled. Fixes [docker/for-mac#6310](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6310).
- Docker Desktop now redacts HTTP proxy passwords in log files and diagnostics.

### Known issues

#### For Linux

- Changing ownership rights for files in bind mounts fails. This is due to the way we have implemented file sharing between the host and VM within which the Docker Engine runs. We aim to resolve this issue in the next release.

> [Mac with Apple chip](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/arm64/77141/Docker.dmg)

### Security

- Update Docker Engine to v20.10.14 to address [CVE-2022-24769](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-24769){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}
- Update containerd to v1.5.11 to address [CVE-2022-24769](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-24769)

### New

- IT Administrators can now install Docker Desktop remotely using the command line.
- Add  the Docker Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) CLI plugin. The new CLI plugin enables users to generate SBOMs for Docker images. For more information, see [Docker SBOM](../engine/sbom/index.md).
- Use [cri-dockerd](https://github.com/Mirantis/cri-dockerd){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}  for new Kubernetes clusters instead of `dockershim`. The change is transparent from the user's point of view and Kubernetes containers run on the Docker Engine as before. `cri-dockerd` allows Kubernetes to manage Docker containers using the standard [Container Runtime Interface](https://github.com/kubernetes/cri-api#readme){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}, the same interface used to control other container runtimes. For more information, see [The Future of Dockershim is cri-dockerd](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/the-future-of-dockershim-is-cri-dockerd/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}.

 - Easily clean up many volumes at once via multi-select checkboxes.
 - Improved login feedback.

#### For Mac 

- Fixed an issue that sometimes caused Docker Desktop to display a blank white screen. Fixes [docker/for-mac#6134](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6134).
- Fixed a problem where gettimeofday() performance drops after waking from sleep when using Hyperkit. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3455](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3455).
- Fixed an issue that caused Docker Desktop to become unresponsive during startup when osxfs is used for file sharing.

#### For Windows

 - Fixed volume title. Fixes [docker/for-win#12616](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12616).
 - Fixed a bug in the WSL 2 integration that caused Docker commands to stop working after restarting Docker Desktop or after switching to Windows containers.

  If using the WSL 2 backend, you must update WSL 2 by running `wsl --update`.

#### For Windows 

- Fixed [CVE-2022-26659](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-26659){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}, which could allow an attacker to overwrite any administrator writable file on the system during the installation or the update of Docker Desktop.

### New

#### For all platforms 

- The Docker Dashboard Volume Management feature now offers the ability to efficiently clean up volumes using multi-select checkboxes.

#### For Mac

- Docker Desktop 4.6.0 gives macOS users the option of enabling a new experimental file sharing technology called VirtioFS. During testing VirtioFS has been shown to drastically reduce the time taken to sync changes between the host and VM, leading to substantial performance improvements. For more information, see [VirtioFS](../mac/#experimental-features).

### Upgrades

#### For all platforms 

- [Docker Engine v20.10.13](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/#201013)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

#### For all platforms 

- Fixed uploading diagnostics when an HTTPS proxy is set.
- Made checking for updates from the systray menu open the Software updates settings section.

#### For Mac

- Fixed the systray menu not displaying all menu items after starting Docker Desktop. Fixes [docker/for-mac#6192](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6192).
- Fixed a regression about Docker Desktop not starting in background anymore. Fixes [docker/for-mac#6167](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6167).
- Fixed missing Docker Desktop Dock icon. Fixes [docker/for-mac#6173](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6173).
- Used speed up block device access when using the experimental `virtualization.framework`. See [benchmarks](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/7#issuecomment-1050626886).
- Increased default VM memory allocation to half of physical memory (min 2 GB, max 8 GB) for better out-of-the-box performances.

#### For Windows 

- Fixed the UI stuck in `starting` state forever although Docker Desktop is working fine from the command line.
- Fixed missing Docker Desktop systray icon [docker/for-win#12573](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12573)
- Fixed Registry Access Management under WSL 2 with latest 5.10.60.1 kernel.
- Fixed a UI crash when selecting the containers of a Compose application started from a WSL 2 environment. Fixes [docker/for-win#12567](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12567).
- Fixed copying text from terminal in Quick Start Guide. Fixes [docker/for-win#12444](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12444).

### Known issues

#### For Mac

- After enabling VirtioFS, containers with processes running with different Unix user IDs may experience caching issues. For example if a process running as `root` queries a file and another process running as user `nginx` tries to access the same file immediately, the `nginx` process will get a "Permission Denied" error.

## Docker Desktop 4.5.1
2022-02-15

> Download Docker Desktop
>
> [For Windows](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/74721/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

#### For Windows 
- Fixed an issue that caused new installations to default to the Hyper-V backend instead of WSL 2.
- Fixed a crash in the Docker Dashboard which would make the systray menu disappear.

If you are running Docker Desktop on Windows Home, installing 4.5.1 will switch it back to WSL 2 automatically. If you are running another version of Windows, and you want Docker Desktop to use the WSL 2 backend, you must manually switch by enabling the **Use the WSL 2 based engine** option in the **Settings > General** section.
Alternatively, you can edit the Docker Desktop settings file located at `%APPDATA%\Docker\settings.json` and manually switch the value of the `wslEngineEnabled` field to `true`.

### Security

#### For Mac

- Fixed [CVE-2021-44719](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44719){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"} where Docker Desktop could be used to access any user file on the host from a container, bypassing the allowed list of shared folders.

#### For Windows

- Fixed [CVE-2022-23774](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23774){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"} where Docker Desktop allows attackers to move arbitrary files.

### New

- Docker Desktop 4.5.0 introduces a new version of the Docker menu which creates a consistent user experience across all operating systems. For more information, see the blog post [New Docker Menu & Improved Release Highlights with Docker Desktop 4.5](https://www.docker.com/blog/new-docker-menu-improved-release-highlights-with-docker-desktop-4-5/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}
- The 'docker version' output now displays the version of Docker Desktop installed on the machine.

### Upgrades

- [Amazon ECR Credential Helper v0.6.0](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-credential-helper/releases/tag/v0.6.0){: target="blank" rel="noopener" class=""}

### Bug fixes and minor changes

#### For all platforms 

- Fixed an issue where Docker Desktop incorrectly prompted users to sign in after they quit Docker Desktop and start the application.
- Increased the filesystem watch (inotify) limits by setting `fs.inotify.max_user_watches=1048576` and `fs.inotify.max_user_instances=8192` in Linux. Fixes [docker/for-mac#6071](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6071).

#### For Mac

- Fixed an issue that caused the VM to become unresponsive during startup when using `osxfs` and when no host directories are shared with the VM.
- Fixed an issue that didn't allow users to stop a Docker Compose application using Docker Dashboard if the application was started in a different version of Docker Compose. For example, if the user started a Docker Compose application in V1 and then switched to Docker Compose V2, attempts to stop the Docker Compose application would fail.
- Fixed an issue where Docker Desktop incorrectly prompted users to sign in after they quit Docker Desktop and start the application.
- Fixed an issue where the **About Docker Desktop** window wasn't working anymore.
- Limit the number of CPUs to 8 on Mac M1 to fix the startup problem. Fixes [docker/for-mac#6063](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6063).

#### For Windows

- Fixed an issue related to compose app started with version 2, but the dashboard only deals with version 1

### Known issues

#### For Windows
Installing Docker Desktop 4.5.0 from scratch has a bug which defaults Docker Desktop to use the Hyper-V backend instead of WSL 2. This means, Windows Home users will not be able to start Docker Desktop as WSL 2 is the only supported backend. To work around this issue, you must uninstall 4.5.0 from your machine and then download and install Docker Desktop 4.5.1 or a higher version. Alternatively, you can edit the Docker Desktop settings.json file located at `%APPDATA%\Docker\settings.json` and manually switch the value of the `wslEngineEnabled` field to `true`.

#### For Windows 

- Fixed logging in from WSL 2. Fixes [docker/for-win#12500](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12500).

### Known issues

#### For Windows

- Clicking **Proceed to Desktop** after signing in through the browser, sometimes does not bring the Dashboard to the front.
- After logging in, when the Dashboard receives focus, it sometimes stays in the foreground even when clicking a background window. As a workaround you need to click the Dashboard before clicking another application window.
- The tips of the week show on top of the mandatory login dialog when an organization restriction is enabled via a `registry.json` file.

> [Mac with Apple chip](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/arm64/73305/Docker.dmg)

### Security

- Fixed [CVE-2021-45449](https://docs.docker.com/security/#cve-2021-45449) that affects users currently on Docker Desktop version 4.3.0 or 4.3.1.

Docker Desktop version 4.3.0 and 4.3.1 has a bug that may log sensitive information (access token or password) on the user's machine during login.
This only affects users if they are on Docker Desktop 4.3.0, 4.3.1 and the user has logged in while on 4.3.0, 4.3.1. Gaining access to this data would require having access to the user’s local files.

### New

- Easy, Secure sign in with Auth0 and Single Sign-on
  - Single Sign-on: Users with a Docker Business subscription can now configure SSO to authenticate using their identity providers (IdPs) to access Docker. For more information, see [Single Sign-on](../single-sign-on/index.md).
  - Signing in to Docker Desktop now takes you through the browser so that you get all the benefits of auto-filling from password managers.

### Upgrades

- [Docker Engine v20.10.12](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/#201012)
- [Compose v2.2.3](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/v2.2.3)
- [Kubernetes 1.22.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.22.5)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

#### For all platforms

- Docker Desktop displays an error if `registry.json` contains more than one organization in the `allowedOrgs` field. If you are using multiple organizations for different groups of developers, you must provision a separate `registry.json` file for each group.
- Fixed a regression in Compose that reverted the container name separator from `-` to `_`. Fixes [docker/compose-switch](https://github.com/docker/compose-switch/issues/24).

#### For Mac

- Fixed the memory statistics for containers in the Dashboard. Fixes [docker/for-mac/#4774](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6076).
- Added a deprecated option to `settings.json`: `"deprecatedCgroupv1": true`, which switches the Linux environment back to cgroups v1. If your software requires cgroups v1, you should update it to be compatible with cgroups v2. Although cgroups v1 should continue to work, it is likely that some future features will depend on cgroups v2. It is also possible that some Linux kernel bugs will only be fixed with cgroups v2.
- Fixed an issue where putting the machine to Sleep mode after pausing Docker Desktop results in Docker Desktop not being able to resume from pause after the machine comes out of Sleep mode. Fixes [for-mac#6058](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6058).

#### For Windows

- Doing a `Reset to factory defaults` no longer shuts down Docker Desktop.

### Known issues

#### For all platforms 

- The tips of the week show on top of the mandatory login dialog when an organization restriction is enabled via a `registry.json` file.

#### For Windows

- Clicking **Proceed to Desktop** after logging in in the browser, sometimes does not bring the Dashboard to the front.
- After logging in, when the Dashboard receives focus, it sometimes stays in the foreground even when clicking a background window. As a workaround you need to click the Dashboard before clicking another application window.
- When the Dashboard is open, even if it does not have focus or is minimized, it will still catch keyboard shortcuts (e.g. ctrl-r for Restart)

### Security

- Fixed [CVE-2021-45449](https://docs.docker.com/security/#cve-2021-45449) that affects users currently on Docker Desktop version 4.3.0 or 4.3.1.

Docker Desktop version 4.3.0 and 4.3.1 has a bug that may log sensitive information (access token or password) on the user's machine during login.
This only affects users if they are on Docker Desktop 4.3.0, 4.3.1 and the user has logged in while on 4.3.0, 4.3.1. Gaining access to this data would require having access to the user’s local files.

- [Go 1.17.3](https://golang.org/doc/go1.17)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

#### For all platforms

- Added a self-diagnose warning if the host lacks Internet connectivity.
- Fixed an issue which prevented users from saving files from a volume using the Save As option in the Volumes UI. Fixes [docker/for-win#12407](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12407).
- Docker Desktop now uses cgroupv2. If you need to run `systemd` in a container then:
  - Ensure your version of `systemd` supports cgroupv2. [It must be at least `systemd` 247](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/19760#issuecomment-851565075). Consider upgrading any `centos:7` images to `centos:8`.
  - Containers running `systemd` need the following options: [`--privileged
    --cgroupns=host -v
    /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:rw`](https://serverfault.com/questions/1053187/systemd-fails-to-run-in-a-docker-container-when-using-cgroupv2-cgroupns-priva).

#### For Mac

- Docker Desktop on Apple silicon no longer requires Rosetta 2, with the exception of [three optional command line tools](mac/apple-silicon.md#known-issues).

#### For Windows

- Fixed an issue that caused Docker Desktop to fail during startup if the home directory path contains a character used in regular expressions. Fixes [docker/for-win#12374](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12374).

### Known issue

Docker Dashboard incorrectly displays the container memory usage as zero on
Hyper-V based machines.
You can use the [`docker stats`](../engine/reference/commandline/stats.md)
command on the command line as a workaround to view the
actual memory usage. See
[docker/for-mac#6076](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6076).

### Deprecation

- The following internal DNS names are deprecated and will be removed from a future release: `docker-for-desktop`, `docker-desktop`, `docker.for.mac.host.internal`, `docker.for.mac.localhost`, `docker.for.mac.gateway.internal`. You must now use `host.docker.internal`, `vm.docker.internal`, and `gateway.docker.internal`.
- Removed: Custom RBAC rules have been removed from Docker Desktop as it gives `cluster-admin` privileges to all Service Accounts. Fixes [docker/for-mac/#4774](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4774).

- Ships [Docker Public Roadmap#226](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/226){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}

**Software Updates**: The option to turn off automatic check for updates is now available for users on all Docker subscriptions, including Docker Personal and Docker Pro. All update-related settings have been moved to the **Software Updates** section. 

- Ships [Docker Public Roadmap#228](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/228){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}

**Window management**: The Docker Dashboard window size and position persists when you close and reopen Docker Desktop.

### Upgrades

- [Docker Engine v20.10.10](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/#201010)
- [containerd v1.4.11](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.4.11)

- [docker-scan 0.9.0](https://github.com/docker/scan-cli-plugin/releases/tag/v0.9.0)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

#### For all platforms

- Improved: Self-diagnose now also checks for overlap between host IPs and `docker networks`.
- Fixed the position of the indicator that displays the availability of an update on the Docker Dashboard.

#### For Mac

- Fixed an issue that caused Docker Desktop to stop responding upon clicking **Exit** on the fatal error dialog.
- Fixed a rare startup failure affecting users having a `docker volume` bind-mounted on top of a directory from the host. If existing, this fix will also remove manually user added `DENY DELETE` ACL entries on the corresponding host directory.
- Fixed a bug where a `Docker.qcow2` file would be ignored on upgrade and a fresh `Docker.raw` used instead, resulting in containers and images disappearing. Note that if a system has both files (due to the previous bug) then the most recently modified file will be used, to avoid recent containers and images disappearing again. To force the use of the old `Docker.qcow2`, delete the newer `Docker.raw` file. Fixes [docker/for-mac#5998](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5998).
- Fixed a bug where subprocesses could fail unexpectedly during shutdown, triggering an unexpected fatal error popup. Fixes [docker/for-mac#5834](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5834).

#### For Windows

- Fixed Docker Desktop sometimes hanging when clicking Exit in the fatal error dialog.
- Fixed an issue that frequently displayed the **Download update** popup when an update has been downloaded but hasn't been applied yet [docker/for-win#12188](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12188).
- Fixed installing a new update killing the application before it has time to shut down.
- Fixed: Installation of Docker Desktop now works even with group policies preventing users to start prerequisite services (e.g. LanmanServer) [docker/for-win#12291](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12291).

> [Mac with Apple chip](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/arm64/69879/Docker.dmg)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

#### For Mac

> When upgrading from 4.1.0, the Docker menu does not change to **Update and restart** so you can just wait for the download to complete (icon changes) and then select **Restart**. This bug is fixed in 4.1.1, for future upgrades.

- Fixed a bug where a `Docker.qcow2` file would be ignored on upgrade and a fresh `Docker.raw` used instead, resulting in containers and images disappearing. If a system has both files (due to the previous bug), then the most recently modified file will be used to avoid recent containers and images disappearing again. To force the use of the old `Docker.qcow2`, delete the newer `Docker.raw` file. Fixes [docker/for-mac#5998](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5998).
- Fixed the update notification overlay sometimes getting out of sync between the **Settings** button and the **Software update** button in the Docker Dashboard.
- Fixed the menu entry to install a newly downloaded Docker Desktop update. When an update is ready to install, the **Restart** option changes to **Update and restart**.

#### For Windows

- Fixed a regression in WSL 2 integrations for some distros (e.g. Arch or Alpine). Fixes [docker/for-win#12229](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12229)
- Fixed update notification overlay sometimes getting out of sync between the Settings button and the Software update button in the Dashboard.

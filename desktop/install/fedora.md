This page contains information on how to install, launch and upgrade Docker Desktop on a Fedora distribution.

[RPM package](https://desktop.docker.com/linux/main/amd64/docker-desktop-4.16.2-x86_64.rpm?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=docs-driven-download-linux-amd64){: .button .primary-btn }

## Prerequisites

To install Docker Desktop successfully, you must:

- Meet the [system requirements](linux-install.md#system-requirements).
- Have a 64-bit version of either Fedora 36 or Fedora 37.

Additionally, for a Gnome Desktop environment you must install AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem [Gnome extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}.

For non-Gnome Desktop environments, `gnome-terminal` must be installed:

```console
$ sudo dnf install gnome-terminal
```

## Install Docker Desktop

To install Docker Desktop on Fedora:

1. Set up [Docker's package repository](../../engine/install/fedora.md#set-up-the-repository).

2. Download latest [RPM package](https://desktop.docker.com/linux/main/amd64/docker-desktop-4.16.2-x86_64.rpm?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=docs-driven-download-linux-amd64).

3. Install the package with dnf as follows:

```console
$ sudo dnf install ./docker-desktop-<version>-<arch>.rpm
```

There are a few post-install configuration steps done through the post-install script contained in the RPM package.

The post-install script:

- Sets the capability on the Docker Desktop binary to map privileged ports and set resource limits.
- Adds a DNS name for Kubernetes to `/etc/hosts`.
- Creates a link from `/usr/bin/docker` to `/usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli`.

## Launch Docker Desktop

{% include desktop-linux-launch.md %}

## Upgrade Docker Desktop

Once a new version for Docker Desktop is released, the Docker UI shows a notification.
You need to first remove the previous version and then download the new package each time you want to upgrade Docker Desktop. Run:

```console
$ sudo dnf remove docker-desktop
$ sudo dnf install ./docker-desktop-<version>-<arch>.rpm
```

## Next steps

- Take a look at the [Get started](../../get-started/index.md) training modules to learn how to build an image and run it as a containerized application.
- Review the topics in [Develop with Docker](../../develop/index.md) to learn how to build new applications using Docker.

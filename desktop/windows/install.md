> **Note**
>
> Docker only supports Docker Desktop on Windows for those versions of Windows 10 that are still within [Microsoft’s servicing timeline](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}.

Containers and images created with Docker Desktop are shared between all
user accounts on machines where it is installed. This is because all Windows
accounts use the same VM to build and run containers. Note that it is not possible to share containers and images between user accounts when using the Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend.

Nested virtualization scenarios, such as running Docker Desktop on a
VMWare or Parallels instance might work, but there are no guarantees. For
more information, see [Running Docker Desktop in nested virtualization scenarios](troubleshoot.md#running-docker-desktop-in-nested-virtualization-scenarios).

### About Windows containers

Looking for information on using Windows containers?

* [Switch between Windows and Linux containers](index.md#switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers)
  describes how you can toggle between Linux and Windows containers in Docker Desktop and points you to the tutorial mentioned above.
* [Getting Started with Windows Containers (Lab)](https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/windows/windows-containers/README.md)
  provides a tutorial on how to set up and run Windows containers on Windows 10, Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019. It shows you how to use a MusicStore application
  with Windows containers.
* Docker Container Platform for Windows [articles and blog
  posts](https://www.docker.com/microsoft/) on the Docker website.

## Install Docker Desktop on Windows

### Install interactively

1. Double-click **Docker Desktop Installer.exe** to run the installer.

    If you haven't already downloaded the installer (`Docker Desktop Installer.exe`), you can get it from
    [**Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/).
    It typically downloads to your `Downloads` folder, or you can run it from
    the recent downloads bar at the bottom of your web browser.

2. When prompted, ensure the **Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V** option on the Configuration page is selected or not depending on your choice of backend.

    If your system only supports one of the two options, you will not be able to select which backend to use.

3. Follow the instructions on the installation wizard to authorize the installer and proceed with the install.

4. When the installation is successful, click **Close** to complete the installation process.

5. If your admin account is different to your user account, you must add the user to the **docker-users** group. Run **Computer Management** as an **administrator** and navigate to **Local Users and Groups** > **Groups** > **docker-users**. Right-click to add the user to the group.
Log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

### Install from the command line

After downloading **Docker Desktop Installer.exe**, run the following command in a terminal to install Docker Desktop:

```
"Docker Desktop Installer.exe" install
```

If you’re using PowerShell you should run it as:

```
Start-Process '.\win\build\Docker Desktop Installer.exe' -Wait install
```

If using the Windows Command Prompt:

```
start /w "" "Docker Desktop Installer.exe" install
```

The install command accepts the following flags:
- `--quiet`: suppresses information output when running the installer
- `--accept-license`: accepts the [Docker Subscription Service Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-subscription-service-agreement){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"} now, rather than requiring it to be accepted when the application is first run
- `--allowed-org=<org name>`: requires the user to sign in and be part of the specified Docker Hub organization when running the application
- `--backend=<backend name>`: selects the backend to use for Docker Desktop, `hyper-v` or `wsl-2` (default)

If your admin account is different to your user account, you must add the user to the **docker-users** group:
```
net localgroup docker-users <user> /add
```

## Start Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop does not start automatically after installation. To start Docker Desktop:

1. Search for Docker, and select **Docker Desktop** in the search results.

      ![search for Docker app](images/docker-app-search.png){:width="300px"}

2. The Docker menu (![whale menu](images/whale-x.png){: .inline}) displays the Docker Subscription Service Agreement window. It includes a change to the terms of use for Docker Desktop.

    {% include desktop-license-update.md %}

3. Click the checkbox to indicate that you accept the updated terms and then click **Accept** to continue. Docker Desktop starts after you accept the terms.

    > **Important**
    >
    > If you do not agree to the updated terms, the Docker Desktop application will close and  you can no longer run Docker Desktop on your machine. You can choose to accept the terms at a later date by opening Docker Desktop.
    {: .important}

    For more information, see [Docker Desktop License Agreement](../../subscription/index.md#docker-desktop-license-agreement). We recommend that you also read the [Blog](https://www.docker.com/blog/updating-product-subscriptions/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_" id="dkr_docs_desktop_install_btl"} and [FAQs](https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_" id="dkr_docs_desktop_install_btl"} to learn how companies using Docker Desktop may be affected.

### Quick Start Guide

When the initialization is complete, Docker Desktop launches the **Quick Start Guide**. This tutorial includes a simple exercise to build an example Docker image, run it as a container, push and save the image to Docker Hub.

To run the Quick Start Guide on demand, right-click the Docker icon in the Notifications area (or System tray) to open the Docker Desktop menu and then select **Quick Start Guide**.

Congratulations! You are now successfully running Docker Desktop on Windows.

## Updates

{% include desktop-update.md %}

## Uninstall Docker Desktop

To uninstall Docker Desktop from your Windows machine:

1. From the Windows **Start** menu, select **Settings** > **Apps** > **Apps & features**.
2. Select **Docker Desktop** from the **Apps & features** list and then select **Uninstall**.
3. Click **Uninstall** to confirm your selection.

> **Important**
>
> Uninstalling Docker Desktop destroys Docker containers, images, volumes, and
> other Docker related data local to the machine, and removes the files generated
> by the application. Refer to the [back up and restore data](../backup-and-restore.md)
> section to learn how to preserve important data before uninstalling.

> .button .primary-btn }

### New

- Docker Desktop 4.5.0 introduces a new version of the Docker menu which creates a consistent user experience across all operating systems. For more information, see the blog post [New Docker Menu & Improved Release Highlights with Docker Desktop 4.5](https://www.docker.com/blog/new-docker-menu-improved-release-highlights-with-docker-desktop-4-5/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}
- The 'docker version' output now displays the version of Docker Desktop installed on the machine.

### Upgrades

- [Amazon ECR Credential Helper v0.6.0](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-credential-helper/releases/tag/v0.6.0){: target="blank" rel="noopener" class=""}

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Increased the filesystem watch (inotify) limits by setting `fs.inotify.max_user_watches=1048576` and `fs.inotify.max_user_instances=8192` in Linux. Fixes [docker/for-mac#6071](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6071).
- Fixed an issue related to compose app started with version 2, but the dashboard only deals with version 1
- Fixed an issue where Docker Desktop incorrectly prompted users to sign in after they quit Docker Desktop and start the application.

## Docker Desktop 4.4.4
2022-01-24

> Download Docker Desktop
>
> [For Windows](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/73704/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Fixed logging in from WSL 2. Fixes [docker/for-win#12500](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12500).

### Known issues

- Clicking **Proceed to Desktop** after signing in through the browser, sometimes does not bring the Dashboard to the front.
- After logging in, when the Dashboard receives focus, it sometimes stays in the foreground even when clicking a background window. As a workaround you need to click the Dashboard before clicking another application window.
- The tips of the week show on top of the mandatory login dialog when an organization restriction is enabled via a `registry.json` file.

## Docker Desktop 4.4.3
2022-01-14

> Download Docker Desktop
>
> [For Windows](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/73365/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Disabled Dashboard shortcuts to prevent capturing them even when minimized or un-focussed. Fixes [docker/for-win#12495](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12495).

### Known issues

- Clicking **Proceed to Desktop** after signing in through the browser, sometimes does not bring the Dashboard to the front.
- After logging in, when the Dashboard receives focus, it sometimes stays in the foreground even when clicking a background window. As a workaround you need to click the Dashboard before clicking another application window.
- The tips of the week show on top of the mandatory login dialog when an organization restriction is enabled via a `registry.json` file.

## Docker Desktop 4.4.2
2022-01-13

> Download Docker Desktop
>
> [For Windows](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/73305/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe)

### Security

- Fixed [CVE-2021-45449](https://docs.docker.com/security/#cve-2021-45449) that affects users currently on Docker Desktop version 4.3.0 or 4.3.1.

Docker Desktop version 4.3.0 and 4.3.1 has a bug that may log sensitive information (access token or password) on the user's machine during login.
This only affects users if they are on Docker Desktop 4.3.0, 4.3.1 and the user has logged in while on 4.3.0, 4.3.1. Gaining access to this data would require having access to the user’s local files.

### New

- Easy, Secure sign in with Auth0 and Single Sign-on
  - Single Sign-on: Users with a Docker Business subscription can now configure SSO to authenticate using their identity providers (IdPs) to access Docker. For more information, see [Single Sign-on](../../../single-sign-on/index.md).
  - Signing in to Docker Desktop now takes you through the browser so that you get all the benefits of auto-filling from password managers.

### Upgrades

- [Docker Engine v20.10.12](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/#201012)
- [Compose v2.2.3](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/v2.2.3)
- [Kubernetes 1.22.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.22.5)
- [docker scan v0.16.0](https://github.com/docker/scan-cli-plugin/releases/tag/v0.16.0){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Docker Desktop displays an error if `registry.json` contains more than one organization in the `allowedOrgs` field. If you are using multiple organizations for different groups of developers, you must provision a separate `registry.json` file for each group.
- Fixed a regression in Compose that reverted the container name separator from `-` to `_`. Fixes [docker/compose-switch](https://github.com/docker/compose-switch/issues/24).
- Doing a `Reset to factory defaults` no longer shuts down Docker Desktop.

### Known issues

- Clicking «Proceed to Desktop» after logging in in the browser, sometimes does not bring the Dashboard to the front.
- After logging in, when the Dashboard receives focus, it sometimes stays in the foreground even when clicking a background window. As a workaround you need to click the Dashboard before clicking another application window.
- The tips of the week show on top of the mandatory login dialog when an organization restriction is enabled via a `registry.json` file.
- When the Dashboard is open, even if it does not have focus or is minimized, it will still catch keyboard shortcuts (e.g. ctrl-r for Restart)

## Docker Desktop 4.3.2
2021-12-21

> Download Docker Desktop
>
> [For Windows](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/72729/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe)

### Security

- Fixed [CVE-2021-45449](https://docs.docker.com/security/#cve-2021-45449) that affects users currently on Docker Desktop version 4.3.0 or 4.3.1.

Docker Desktop version 4.3.0 and 4.3.1 has a bug that may log sensitive information (access token or password) on the user's machine during login.
This only affects users if they are on Docker Desktop 4.3.0, 4.3.1 and the user has logged in while on 4.3.0, 4.3.1. Gaining access to this data would require having access to the user’s local files.

## Docker Desktop 4.3.0
2021-12-02

> Download Docker Desktop
>
> [For Windows](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/71786/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe)


### Upgrades

- [Docker Engine v20.10.11](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/#201011)
- [containerd v1.4.12](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.4.12)
- [Buildx 0.7.1](https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.7.1)
- [Compose v2.2.1](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/v2.2.1)
- [Kubernetes 1.22.4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.22.4)
- [Docker Hub Tool v0.4.4](https://github.com/docker/hub-tool/releases/tag/v0.4.4)
- [Go 1.17.3](https://golang.org/doc/go1.17)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Fixed an issue which prevented users from saving files from a volume using the Save As option in the Volumes UI. Fixes [docker/for-win#12407](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12407).
- Fixed an issue that caused Docker Desktop to fail during startup if the home directory path contains a character used in regular expressions. Fixes [docker/for-win#12374](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12374).
- Added a self-diagnose warning if the host lacks Internet connectivity.
- Docker Desktop now uses cgroupv2. If you need to run `systemd` in a container then:
  - Ensure your version of `systemd` supports cgroupv2. [It must be at least `systemd` 247](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/19760#issuecomment-851565075). Consider upgrading any `centos:7` images to `centos:8`.
  - Containers running `systemd` need the following options: [`--privileged
    --cgroupns=host -v
    /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:rw`](https://serverfault.com/questions/1053187/systemd-fails-to-run-in-a-docker-container-when-using-cgroupv2-cgroupns-priva).

### Known issue

Docker Dashboard incorrectly displays the container memory usage as zero on
Hyper-V based machines.
You can use the [`docker stats`](../../../engine/reference/commandline/stats.md)
command on the command line as a workaround to view the
actual memory usage. See
[docker/for-mac#6076](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6076).

### Deprecation

- The following internal DNS names are deprecated and will be removed from a future release: `docker-for-desktop`, `docker-desktop`, `docker.for.mac.host.internal`, `docker.for.mac.localhost`, `docker.for.mac.gateway.internal`. You must now use `host.docker.internal`, `vm.docker.internal`, and `gateway.docker.internal`.
- Removed: Custom RBAC rules have been removed from Docker Desktop as it gives `cluster-admin` privileges to all Service Accounts. Fixes [docker/for-mac/#4774](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4774).

> **Update to the Docker Desktop terms**
>
> Professional use of Docker Desktop in large organizations (more than 250 employees or more than $10 million in annual revenue) requires users to have a paid Docker subscription. While the effective date of these terms is August 31, 2021, there is a grace period until January 31, 2022 for those that require a paid subscription. For more information, see [Docker Desktop License Agreement](../../../subscription/index.md#docker-desktop-license-agreement).

### Upgrades

[docker scan v0.11.0](https://github.com/docker/scan-cli-plugin/releases/tag/v0.11.0){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}

### Security

**Log4j 2 CVE-2021-44228**: We have updated the `docker scan` CLI plugin for you.
Older versions of `docker scan` in Docker Desktop 4.3.0 and earlier versions are
not able to detect [Log4j 2
CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228){:
target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}.

For more information, read the
blog post [Apache Log4j 2
CVE-2021-44228](https://www.docker.com/blog/apache-log4j-2-cve-2021-44228/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}.

## Docker Desktop 4.3.0
2021-12-02

> Download Docker Desktop
>
> [For Windows](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/71786/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe)


### Upgrades

- [Docker Engine v20.10.11](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/#201011)
- [containerd v1.4.12](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.4.12)
- [Buildx 0.7.1](https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.7.1)
- [Compose v2.2.1](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/v2.2.1)
- [Kubernetes 1.22.4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.22.4)
- [Docker Hub Tool v0.4.4](https://github.com/docker/hub-tool/releases/tag/v0.4.4)
- [Go 1.17.3](https://golang.org/doc/go1.17)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Fixed an issue which prevented users from saving files from a volume using the Save As option in the Volumes UI. Fixes [docker/for-win#12407](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12407).
- Fixed an issue that caused Docker Desktop to fail during startup if the home directory path contains a character used in regular expressions. Fixes [docker/for-win#12374](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12374).
- Added a self-diagnose warning if the host lacks Internet connectivity.
- Docker Desktop now uses cgroupv2. If you need to run `systemd` in a container then:
  - Ensure your version of `systemd` supports cgroupv2. [It must be at least `systemd` 247](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/19760#issuecomment-851565075). Consider upgrading any `centos:7` images to `centos:8`.
  - Containers running `systemd` need the following options: [`--privileged
    --cgroupns=host -v
    /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:rw`](https://serverfault.com/questions/1053187/systemd-fails-to-run-in-a-docker-container-when-using-cgroupv2-cgroupns-priva).

### Known issue

Docker Dashboard incorrectly displays the container memory usage as zero on
Hyper-V based machines.
You can use the [`docker stats`](../../../engine/reference/commandline/stats.md)
command on the command line as a workaround to view the
actual memory usage. See
[docker/for-mac#6076](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6076).

### Deprecation

- The following internal DNS names are deprecated and will be removed from a future release: `docker-for-desktop`, `docker-desktop`, `docker.for.mac.host.internal`, `docker.for.mac.localhost`, `docker.for.mac.gateway.internal`. You must now use `host.docker.internal`, `vm.docker.internal`, and `gateway.docker.internal`.
- Removed: Custom RBAC rules have been removed from Docker Desktop as it gives `cluster-admin` privileges to all Service Accounts. Fixes [docker/for-mac/#4774](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4774).

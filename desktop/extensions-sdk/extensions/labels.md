[Labels](../../../engine/reference/builder.md#label) are specified in the extension's `Dockerfile` and used to provide information about the extension.

| Label                                       | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

If you don't specify this label, users won't be able to find your extension in the Extension Marketplace when filtering by a category. Extensions published to the Marketplace before the 22nd of September 2022 have been auto-categorized by Docker. | Specified as comma separated values in case of having multiple categories e.g: `kubernetes,security` or a single value e.g. `kubernetes`.                                                                                                          |

> Missing required labels
>
> If any of the previous _required_ labels are missing in the `Dockerfile`, Docker Desktop considers the extension invalid and does not list it in the Marketplace.

> HTML content styling
>
> Docker Desktop CSS styles will be applied to the provided HTML content. You can make sure that it renders nicely [within the marketplace](#preview-the-extension-in-the-marketplace). We recommend that you follow our [Styling guidelines](../design/overview.md).

## Preview the extension in the Marketplace

You can validate that the image labels render as you expect.

When you build and install your unpublished extension, you can preview the extension in the Marketplace "installed" tab. You can see how the extension labels are rendered in the list and in the details page of the extension.

> Preview extensions already listed in Marketplace
>
> When you install a local image of an extension already published in the Marketplace, for example with the tag `latest`, your local image is currently not detected as "unpublished".
>
> You can retag your image in order to have a different image name that is not listed as a published extension.
> Use `docker tag org/published-extension unpublished-extension` and then `docker extension install unpublished-extension`.

To start creating your extension, you first need a directory with files which range from the extension’s source code to the required extension-specific files. This page provides information on how to set up a minimal frontend extension based on plain HTML.

> Note
>
> Before you start, make sure you have installed the latest version of [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

> Note
>
> If you want to start a codebase for your new extension, our [Quickstart guide](../quickstart.md) and `docker extension init <my-extension>` will provide a better base for your extension, more up-to-date and related to your install of Docker Desktop.

## Extension folder structure

In the `minimal-frontend` [sample folder](https://github.com/docker/extensions-sdk/tree/main/samples){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}, you can find a ready-to-go example that represents a UI Extension built on HTML. We will go through this code example in this tutorial.

Although you can start from an empty directory, it is highly recommended that you start from the template below and change it accordingly to suit your needs.

```bash
.
├── Dockerfile # (1)
├── metadata.json # (2)
└── ui # (3)
    └── index.html
```

1. Contains everything required to build the extension and run it in Docker Desktop.
2. A file that provides information about the extension such as the name, description, and version.
3. The source folder that contains all your HTML, CSS and JS files. There can also be other static assets such as logos
   and icons. For more information and guidelines on building the UI, see the [Design and UI styling section](../design/design-guidelines.md).

## Create a Dockerfile

At a minimum, your Dockerfile needs:

- [Labels](../extensions/labels.md) which provide extra information about the extension, icon and screenshots.
- The source code which in this case is an `index.html` that sits within the `ui` folder.
- The `metadata.json` file.

```Dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM scratch

LABEL org.opencontainers.image.title="Minimal frontend" \
    org.opencontainers.image.description="A sample extension to show how easy it's to get started with Desktop Extensions." \
    org.opencontainers.image.vendor="Awesome Inc." \
    com.docker.desktop.extension.api.version="0.3.3" \
    com.docker.desktop.extension.icon="https://www.docker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moby-logo.png"

COPY ui ./ui
COPY metadata.json .
```

## Configure the metadata file

A `metadata.json` file is required at the root of the image filesystem.

```json
{
  "ui": {
    "dashboard-tab": {
      "title": "Minimal frontend",
      "root": "/ui",
      "src": "index.html"
    }
  }
}
```

For more information on the `metadata.json`, see [Metadata](../architecture/metadata.md).

## Build the extension and install it

Now that you have configured the extension, you need to build the extension image that Docker Desktop will use to
install it.

```console
$ docker build --tag= awesome-inc/my-extension:latest .
```

This built an image tagged `awesome-inc/my-extension:latest`, you can run `docker inspect awesome-inc/my-extension:latest` to see more details about it.

Finally, you can install the extension and see it appearing in the Docker Desktop Dashboard.

```console
$ docker extension install awesome-inc/my-extension:latest
```

## Preview the extension

To preview the extension in Docker Desktop, close and open Docker Dashboard once the installation is complete.

The left-hand menu displays a new tab with the name of your extension.

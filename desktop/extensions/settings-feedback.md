update your settings:

1. Navigate to  **Settings**, or **Preferences** if you're a Mac user.
2. Select the **Extensions** tab.

## Submit feedback
Feedback can be given to an extension author through a dedicated Slack channel or Github. To submit feedback about a particular extension:

1. Navigate to Docker Dashboard and from the menu bar select the ellipsis to the right of **Extensions**.
2. Click **Manage Extensions**.
3. Select the extension you want to provide feedback on. 
4. Scroll down to the bottom of the extension's description and, depending on the 
extension, select:
    - Support
    - Slack
    - Issues. You'll be sent to a page outside of Docker Desktop to submit your feedback.

If an extension does not provide a way for you to give feedback, contact us and we'll pass on the feedback for you. To provide feedback, select the **Give feedback** to the right of **Extensions Marketplace**.

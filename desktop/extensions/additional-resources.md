## See containers created by extensions

By default, containers created by extensions are hidden from the list of containers in Docker Dashboard and the Docker CLI. To make them visible 
update your settings:

1. Navigate to  **Settings**, or **Preferences** if you're a Mac user.
2. Select the **Extensions** tab.
3. Next to **Show Docker Extensions system containers**, select or clear the checkbox to set your desired state.
4. In the bottom-right corner, click **Apply & Restart**.

## Submit feedback
Feedback can be given to an extension author through a dedicated Slack channel or Github. To submit feedback about a particular extension:

1. Navigate to Docker Dashboard and from the menu bar select the ellipsis to the right of **Extensions**.
2. Click **Manage Extensions**.
3. Select the extension you want to provide feedback on. 
4. Scroll down to the bottom of the extension's description and, depending on the 
extension, select:
    - Support
    - Slack
    - Issues. You'll be sent to a page outside of Docker Desktop to submit your feedback.

If an extension does not provide a way for you to give feedback, contact us and we'll pass on the feedback for you. To provide feedback, select the **Give feedback** to the right of **Extensions Marketplace**

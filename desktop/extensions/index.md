> The Docker Extensions feature is currently in [Beta](../../release-lifecycle.md#beta). We recommend that you do not use Docker Extensions in production environments.

Docker Extensions lets you use third-party tools within Docker Desktop to extend its functionality. There is no limit to the number of extensions you can install.

You can explore the list of available extensions in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=extension) or in the Extensions Marketplace within Docker Desktop.

Docker Community members and partners can use our [SDK](../extensions-sdk/index.md) to create new extensions.

To find out more about Docker Extensions, we recommend the video walkthrough from DockerCon 2022:

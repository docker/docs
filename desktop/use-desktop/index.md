When you open Docker Desktop, the Docker Dashboard displays.

![Docker Dashboard on Containers view](../images/dashboard.PNG){:width="750px"}

The **Containers** view provides a runtime view of all your containers and applications. It allows you to interact with containers and applications, and manage the lifecycle of your applications directly from your machine. This view also provides an intuitive interface to perform common actions to inspect, interact with, and manage your Docker objects including containers and Docker Compose-based applications. For more information, see [Explore running containers and applications](container.md).

The **Images** view displays a list of your Docker images and allows you to run an image as a container, pull the latest version of an image from Docker Hub, and inspect images. It also displays a summary of the vulnerability scanning report using Snyk. In addition, the **Images** view contains clean-up options to remove unwanted images from the disk to reclaim space. If you are logged in, you can also see the images you and your organization have shared on Docker Hub. For more information, see [Explore your images](images.md).

The **Volumes** view displays a list of volumes and allows you to easily create and delete volumes and see which ones are being used. For more information, see [Explore volumes](volumes.md).

In addition, the Docker Dashboard allows you to:

- Easily navigate to the **Settings** menu to configure Docker Desktop preferences. Select the **Settings** icon in the Dashboard header.
- Access the **Troubleshoot** menu to debug and perform restart operations. Select the **Troubleshoot** icon in the Dashboard header.

## Quick search

From the Docker Dashboard you can use Quick Search, which is located in the Dashboard header, to search for:

- Any container or Compose app on your local system. You can see an overview of associated environment variables or perform quick actions, such as start, stop, or delete.

- Public Docker Hub images, local images, and images from remote repositories. Depending on the type of image you select, you can either pull the image by tag, view documentation, go to Docker Hub for more details, or run a new container using the image.

- Extensions. From here, you can learn more about the extension and install it with a single click. Or, if you already have an extension installed, you can open it straight from the search results.

- Any volume. From here you can view the associated container.

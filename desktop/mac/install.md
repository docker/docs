## System requirements

Your Mac must meet the following requirements to install Docker Desktop successfully.

### Mac with Intel chip

- **macOS must be version 10.15 or newer**. That is, Catalina, Big Sur, or Monterey. We recommend upgrading to the latest version of macOS.

  If you experience any issues after upgrading your macOS to version 10.15, you must install the latest version of Docker Desktop to be compatible with this version of macOS.

  > **Note**
  >
  > Docker supports Docker Desktop on the most recent versions of macOS. That is, the current release of macOS and the previous two releases. As new major versions of macOS are made generally available, Docker stops supporting the oldest version and supports the newest version of macOS (in addition to the previous two releases). Docker Desktop currently supports macOS Catalina, macOS Big Sur, and macOS Monterey.

- At least 4 GB of RAM.

- VirtualBox prior to version 4.3.30 must not be installed as it is not compatible with Docker Desktop.

### Mac with Apple silicon

- Beginning with Docker Desktop 4.3.0, we have removed the hard requirement to install **Rosetta 2**. There are a few optional command line tools that still require Rosetta 2 when using Darwin/AMD64. See the [Known issues section](apple-silicon.md#known-issues). However, to get the best experience, we recommend that you install Rosetta 2. To install Rosetta 2 manually from the command line, run the following command:

  ```console
  $ softwareupdate --install-rosetta
  ```

 For more information, see [Docker Desktop for Apple silicon](apple-silicon.md).

## Install and run Docker Desktop on Mac

### Install interactively

1. Double-click `Docker.dmg` to open the installer, then drag the Docker icon to
    the Applications folder.

      ![Install Docker app](images/docker-app-drag.png)

2. Double-click `Docker.app` in the Applications folder to start Docker. In the example below, the Applications folder is in "grid" view mode.

    ![Docker app in Hockeyapp](images/docker-app-in-apps.png)

3. The Docker menu (![whale menu](images/whale-x.png){: .inline}) displays the Docker Subscription Service Agreement window. It includes a change to the terms of use for Docker Desktop.

    {% include desktop-license-update.md %}

4. Click the checkbox to indicate that you accept the updated terms and then click **Accept** to continue. Docker Desktop starts after you accept the terms.

    > **Important**
    >
    > If you do not agree to the terms, the Docker Desktop application will close and  you can no longer run Docker Desktop on your machine. You can choose to accept the terms at a later date by opening Docker Desktop.
    {: .important}

    For more information, see [Docker Desktop License Agreement](../../subscription/index.md#docker-desktop-license-agreement). We recommend that you also read the [Blog](https://www.docker.com/blog/updating-product-subscriptions/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_" id="dkr_docs_desktop_install_btl"} and [FAQs](https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_" id="dkr_docs_desktop_install_btl"} to learn how companies using Docker Desktop may be affected.

### Install from the command line

After downloading `Docker.dmg`, run the following commands in a terminal to install Docker Desktop in the Applications folder:

```console
$ sudo hdiutil attach Docker.dmg
$ sudo /Volumes/Docker/Docker.app/Contents/MacOS/install
$ sudo hdiutil detach /Volumes/Docker
```

The `install` command accepts the following flags:
- `--accept-license`: accepts the [Docker Subscription Service Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-subscription-service-agreement){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"} now, rather than requiring it to be accepted when the application is first run
- `--allowed-org=<org name>`: requires the user to sign in and be part of the specified Docker Hub organization when running the application

### Quick start guide

  If you've just installed the app, Docker Desktop launches the Quick Start Guide. The tutorial includes a simple exercise to build an example Docker image, run it as a container, push and save the image to Docker Hub.

   ![Docker Quick Start tutorial](images/docker-tutorial-mac.png)

Congratulations! You are now successfully running Docker Desktop. Click the Docker menu (![whale menu](images/whale-x.png){: .inline}) to see
**Preferences** and other options. To run the Quick Start Guide on demand, select the Docker menu and then choose **Quick Start Guide**.

## Updates

{% include desktop-update.md %}

## Uninstall Docker Desktop

To uninstall Docker Desktop from your Mac:

1. From the Docker menu, select **Troubleshoot** and then select **Uninstall**.
2. Click **Uninstall** to confirm your selection.

> **Note**
>
> Uninstalling Docker Desktop destroys Docker containers, images, volumes, and
> other Docker related data local to the machine, and removes the files generated
> by the application. Refer to the [back up and restore data](../backup-and-restore.md)
> section to learn how to preserve important data before uninstalling.

### Security

- Fixed [CVE-2021-45449](https://docs.docker.com/security/#cve-2021-45449) that affects users currently on Docker Desktop version 4.3.0 or 4.3.1.

Docker Desktop version 4.3.0 and 4.3.1 has a bug that may log sensitive information (access token or password) on the user's machine during login.
This only affects users if they are on Docker Desktop 4.3.0, 4.3.1 and the user has logged in while on 4.3.0, 4.3.1. Gaining access to this data would require having access to the user’s local files.

### New

- Easy, Secure sign in with Auth0 and Single Sign-on
  - Single Sign-on: Users with a Docker Business subscription can now configure SSO to authenticate using their identity providers (IdPs) to access Docker. For more information, see [Single Sign-on](../../../single-sign-on/index.md).
  - Signing in to Docker Desktop now takes you through the browser so that you get all the benefits of auto-filling from password managers.

### Upgrades

- [Docker Engine v20.10.12](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/#201012)
- [Compose v2.2.3](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/v2.2.3)
- [Kubernetes 1.22.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.22.5)
- [docker scan v0.16.0](https://github.com/docker/scan-cli-plugin/releases/tag/v0.16.0){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Docker Desktop displays an error if `registry.json` contains more than one organization in the `allowedOrgs` field. If you are using multiple organizations for different groups of developers, you must provision a separate `registry.json` file for each group.
- Fixed the memory statistics for containers in the Dashboard. Fixes [docker/for-mac/#4774](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6076).
- Added a deprecated option to `settings.json`: `"deprecatedCgroupv1": true`, which switches the Linux environment back to cgroups v1. If your software requires cgroups v1, you should update it to be compatible with cgroups v2. Although cgroups v1 should continue to work, it is likely that some future features will depend on cgroups v2. It is also possible that some Linux kernel bugs will only be fixed with cgroups v2.
- Fixed a regression in Compose that reverted the container name separator from `-` to `_`. Fixes [docker/compose-switch](https://github.com/docker/compose-switch/issues/24).
- Fixed an issue where putting the machine to Sleep mode after pausing Docker Desktop results in Docker Desktop not being able to resume from pause after the machine comes out of Sleep mode. Fixes [for-mac#6058](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6058).

### Known issues

- The tips of the week show on top of the mandatory login dialog when an organization restriction is enabled via a `registry.json` file.

## Docker Desktop 4.3.0
2021-12-02

> [Mac with Intel chip](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/amd64/71786/Docker.dmg) |
> [Mac with Apple chip](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/arm64/71786/Docker.dmg)

### Upgrades

- [Docker Engine v20.10.11](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/#201011)
- [containerd v1.4.12](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.4.12)
- [Buildx 0.7.1](https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.7.1)

- [Docker Hub Tool v0.4.4](https://github.com/docker/hub-tool/releases/tag/v0.4.4)
- [Go 1.17.3](https://golang.org/doc/go1.17)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Docker Desktop on Apple silicon no longer requires Rosetta 2, with the exception of [three optional command line tools](../apple-silicon/#known-issues).
- Fixed an issue which prevented users from saving files from a volume using the Save As option in the Volumes UI. Fixes [docker/for-win#12407](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12407).
- Fixed an issue that sometimes launched the existing version of Docker Desktop even after updating to a newer version.
- Added a self-diagnose warning if the host lacks Internet connectivity.
- Docker Desktop now uses cgroupv2. If you need to run `systemd` in a container then:
  - Ensure your version of `systemd` supports cgroupv2. [It must be at least `systemd` 247](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/19760#issuecomment-851565075). Consider upgrading any `centos:7` images to `centos:8`.
  - Containers running `systemd` need the following options: [`--privileged --cgroupns=host -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:rw`](https://serverfault.com/questions/1053187/systemd-fails-to-run-in-a-docker-container-when-using-cgroupv2-cgroupns-priva).

### Known issue

Docker Dashboard incorrectly displays the container memory usage as zero.
You can use the [`docker stats`](../../../engine/reference/commandline/stats.md)
command on the command line as a workaround to view the
actual memory usage. See
[docker/for-mac#6076](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6076).

### Deprecation

- The following internal DNS names are deprecated and will be removed from a future release: `docker-for-desktop`, `docker-desktop`, `docker.for.mac.host.internal`, `docker.for.mac.localhost`, `docker.for.mac.gateway.internal`. You must now use `host.docker.internal`, `vm.docker.internal`, and `gateway.docker.internal`.
- Custom RBAC rules have been removed from Docker Desktop as it gives `cluster-admin` privileges to all Service Accounts. Fixes [docker/for-mac/#4774](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4774).

## Docker Desktop 4.2.0
2021-11-09

> Download Docker Desktop

> [Mac with Apple chip](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/arm64/70708/Docker.dmg)

### New

**Pause/Resume**: You can now pause your Docker Desktop session when you are not actively using it and save CPU resources on your machine. For more information, see [Pause/Resume](../index.md#pauseresume).

- Ships [Docker Public Roadmap#226](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/226){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}

**Software Updates**: The option to turn off automatic check for updates is now available for users on all Docker subscriptions, including Docker Personal and Docker Pro. All update-related settings have been moved to the **Software Updates** section. For more information, see [Software updates](../index.md#software-updates).

- Ships [Docker Public Roadmap#228](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/228){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}

**Window management**: The Docker Dashboard window size and position persists when you close and reopen Docker Desktop.

### Upgrades

- [Docker Engine v20.10.10](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/#201010)
- [containerd v1.4.11](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.4.11)
- [runc v1.0.2](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.2)
- [Go 1.17.2](https://golang.org/doc/go1.17)
- [Compose v2.1.1](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/v2.1.1)
- [docker-scan 0.9.0](https://github.com/docker/scan-cli-plugin/releases/tag/v0.9.0)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Improved: Self-diagnose now also checks for overlap between host IPs and `docker networks`.
- Fixed the position of the indicator that displays the availability of an update on the Docker Dashboard.
- Fixed an issue that caused Docker Desktop to stop responding upon clicking **Exit** on the fatal error dialog.
- Fixed a rare startup failure affecting users having a `docker volume` bind-mounted on top of a directory from the host. If existing, this fix will also remove manually user added `DENY DELETE` ACL entries on the corresponding host directory.
- Fixed a bug where a `Docker.qcow2` file would be ignored on upgrade and a fresh `Docker.raw` used instead, resulting in containers and images disappearing. Note that if a system has both files (due to the previous bug) then the most recently modified file will be used, to avoid recent containers and images disappearing again. To force the use of the old `Docker.qcow2`, delete the newer `Docker.raw` file. Fixes [docker/for-mac#5998](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5998).
- Fixed a bug where subprocesses could fail unexpectedly during shutdown, triggering an unexpected fatal error popup. Fixes [docker/for-mac#5834](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5834).


## Docker Desktop 4.1.1

> [Mac with Apple chip](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/arm64/69879/Docker.dmg)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

> When upgrading from 4.1.0, the Docker menu does not change to **Update and restart** so you can just wait for the download to complete (icon changes) and then select **Restart**. This bug is fixed in 4.1.1, for future upgrades.

- Fixed a bug where a `Docker.qcow2` file would be ignored on upgrade and a fresh `Docker.raw` used instead, resulting in containers and images disappearing. If a system has both files (due to the previous bug), then the most recently modified file will be used to avoid recent containers and images disappearing again. To force the use of the old `Docker.qcow2`, delete the newer `Docker.raw` file. Fixes [docker/for-mac#5998](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5998).
- Fixed the update notification overlay sometimes getting out of sync between the **Settings** button and the **Software update** button in the Docker Dashboard.
- Fixed the menu entry to install a newly downloaded Docker Desktop update. When an update is ready to install, the **Restart** option changes to **Update and restart**.

### New

Docker has [announced](https://www.docker.com/blog/updating-product-subscriptions/){: target="*blank" rel="noopener" class="*" id="dkr_docs_relnotes_btl"} updates and extensions to the product subscriptions to increase productivity, collaboration, and added security for our developers and businesses.

The updated [Docker Subscription Service Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-subscription-service-agreement) includes a change to the terms for **Docker Desktop**.

- Docker Desktop **remains free** for small businesses (fewer than 250 employees AND less than $10 million in annual revenue), personal use, education, and non-commercial open source projects.
- It requires a paid subscription (**Pro, Team, or Business**), for as little as $5 a month, for professional use in larger enterprises.
- The effective date of these terms is August 31, 2021. There is a grace period until January 31, 2022 for those that will require a paid subscription to use Docker Desktop.
- The Docker Pro and Docker Team subscriptions now **include commercial use** of Docker Desktop.
- The existing Docker Free subscription has been renamed **Docker Personal**.
- **No changes** to Docker Engine or any other upstream **open source** Docker or Moby project.

To understand how these changes affect you, read the [FAQs](https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq){: target="*blank" rel="noopener" class="*" id="dkr_docs_relnotes_btl"}. For more information, see [Docker subscription overview](../../../subscription/index.md).

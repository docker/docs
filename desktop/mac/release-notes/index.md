### New

Docker has [announced](https://www.docker.com/blog/updating-product-subscriptions/){: target="*blank" rel="noopener" class="*" id="dkr_docs_relnotes_btl"} updates and extensions to the product subscriptions to increase productivity, collaboration, and added security for our developers and businesses.

The updated [Docker Subscription Service Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-subscription-service-agreement) includes a change to the terms for **Docker Desktop**.

- Docker Desktop **remains free** for small businesses (fewer than 250 employees AND less than $10 million in annual revenue), personal use, education, and non-commercial open source projects.
- It requires a paid subscription (**Pro, Team, or Business**), for as little as $5 a month, for professional use in larger enterprises.
- The effective date of these terms is August 31, 2021. There is a grace period until January 31, 2022 for those that will require a paid subscription to use Docker Desktop.
- The Docker Pro and Docker Team subscriptions now **include commercial use** of Docker Desktop.
- The existing Docker Free subscription has been renamed **Docker Personal**.
- **No changes** to Docker Engine or any other upstream **open source** Docker or Moby project.

To understand how these changes affect you, read the [FAQs](https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq){: target="*blank" rel="noopener" class="*" id="dkr_docs_relnotes_btl"}. For more information, see [Docker subscription overview](../../../subscription/index.md).

### Upgrades

- [Compose V2 RC2](https://github.com/docker/compose-cli/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.2)
  - Fixed project name to be case-insensitive for `compose down`. See [docker/compose-cli#2023](https://github.com/docker/compose-cli/issues/2023)
  - Fixed non-normalized project name.
  - Fixed port merging on partial reference.
- [Kubernetes 1.21.4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.21.4)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Fixed a bug where SSH was not available for builds from git URL. Fixes [for-mac#5902](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5902)

> **Update to the Docker Desktop terms**
>
> Professional use of Docker Desktop in large organizations (more than 250 employees or more than $10 million in annual revenue) requires users to have a paid Docker subscription. While the effective date of these terms is August 31, 2021, there is a grace period until January 31, 2022 for those that require a paid subscription. For more information, see [Docker Desktop License Agreement](../../../subscription/index.md#docker-desktop-license-agreement).

## Docker Desktop 4.2.0

> [Mac with Intel chip](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/amd64/Docker.dmg?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=docs-driven-download-mac-amd64){: .button .primary-btn }

### New

- **Pause/Resume**: You can now pause your Docker Desktop session when you are not actively using it and save CPU resources on your machine. For more information, see [Pause/Resume](../index.md#pauseresume).
- **Software Updates**: The option to turn off automatic check for updates is now available for users on all Docker subscriptions, including Docker Personal and Docker Pro. All update-related settings have been moved to the **Software Updates** section. For more information, see [Software updates](../index.md#software-updates).
- **Window management**: The Docker Dashboard window size and position persists when you close and reopen Docker Desktop.

### Upgrades

- [Docker Engine v20.10.10](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/#201010)
- [containerd v1.4.11](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.4.11)
- [runc v1.0.2](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.2)
- [Go 1.17.2](https://golang.org/doc/go1.17)
- [Compose CLI v2.1.1](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/v2.1.1)
- [docker-scan 0.9.0](https://github.com/docker/scan-cli-plugin/releases/tag/v0.9.0)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Improved: Self-diagnose now also checks for overlap between host IPs and `docker networks`.
- Fixed the position of the indicator that displays the availability of an update on the Docker Dashboard.
- Fixed an issue that caused Docker Desktop to stop responding upon clicking **Exit** on the fatal error dialog.
- Fixed a rare startup failure affecting users having a `docker volume` bind-mounted on top of a directory from the host. If existing, this fix will also remove manually user added `DENY DELETE` ACL entries on the corresponding host directory.
- Fixed a bug where a `Docker.qcow2` file would be ignored on upgrade and a fresh `Docker.raw` used instead, resulting in containers and images disappearing. Note that if a system has both files (due to the previous bug) then the most recently modified file will be used, to avoid recent containers and images disappearing again. To force the use of the old `Docker.qcow2`, delete the newer `Docker.raw` file. Fixes [docker/for-mac#5998](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5998).
- Fixed a bug where subprocesses could fail unexpectedly during shutdown, triggering an unexpected fatal error popup. Fixes [docker/for-mac#5834](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5834).


## Docker Desktop 4.1.1
2021-10-12

> Download Docker Desktop

> [Mac with Intel chip](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/amd64/69879/Docker.dmg) |
> [Mac with Apple chip](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/arm64/69879/Docker.dmg)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

> When upgrading from 4.1.0, the Docker menu does not change to **Update and restart** so you can just wait for the download to complete (icon changes) and then select **Restart**. This bug is fixed in 4.1.1, for future upgrades.

- Fixed a bug where a `Docker.qcow2` file would be ignored on upgrade and a fresh `Docker.raw` used instead, resulting in containers and images disappearing. If a system has both files (due to the previous bug), then the most recently modified file will be used to avoid recent containers and images disappearing again. To force the use of the old `Docker.qcow2`, delete the newer `Docker.raw` file. Fixes [docker/for-mac#5998](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5998).
- Fixed the update notification overlay sometimes getting out of sync between the **Settings** button and the **Software update** button in the Docker Dashboard.
- Fixed the menu entry to install a newly downloaded Docker Desktop update. When an update is ready to install, the **Restart** option changes to **Update and restart**.

### New

Docker has [announced](https://www.docker.com/blog/updating-product-subscriptions/){: target="*blank" rel="noopener" class="*" id="dkr_docs_relnotes_btl"} updates and extensions to the product subscriptions to increase productivity, collaboration, and added security for our developers and businesses.

The updated [Docker Subscription Service Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-subscription-service-agreement) includes a change to the terms for **Docker Desktop**.

- Docker Desktop **remains free** for small businesses (fewer than 250 employees AND less than $10 million in annual revenue), personal use, education, and non-commercial open source projects.
- It requires a paid subscription (**Pro, Team, or Business**), for as little as $5 a month, for professional use in larger enterprises.
- The effective date of these terms is August 31, 2021. There is a grace period until January 31, 2022 for those that will require a paid subscription to use Docker Desktop.
- The Docker Pro and Docker Team subscriptions now **include commercial use** of Docker Desktop.
- The existing Docker Free subscription has been renamed **Docker Personal**.
- **No changes** to Docker Engine or any other upstream **open source** Docker or Moby project.

To understand how these changes affect you, read the [FAQs](https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq){: target="*blank" rel="noopener" class="*" id="dkr_docs_relnotes_btl"}. For more information, see [Docker subscription overview](../../../subscription/index.md).

### Known issues

- DockerNAT has been removed from Docker Desktop 2.2.0.0 as using an IP address to communicate from the host to a container is not a supported feature. To communicate from a container to the host, you must use the special DNS name `host.docker.internal`. We also recommend using ports to communicate from the host to a container. For more information, see [Networking](../windows/networking.md#use-cases-and-workarounds).

  However, if your current setup relies on IP addresses for communication, you can use a temporary workaround to reinstate DockerNAT. To do this, open
`C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\MobyLinux.ps1` and add `$SwitchName = "DockerNAT"` between line 175 and 176. Note that the temporary workaround to reinstate DockerNAT may be removed from future releases.
- Directory junctions in shared volumes pointing outside the shared volume do not work.
- It is currently not possible to rename open files within shared volumes.
- In some cases, Docker containers do not synchronize time with the host when the host machine is put to sleep.
- It is not possible to use `localhost` in the proxy settings. You can instead use `host.docker.internal` to work around this issue.

- Docker Desktop now automatically restarts after an update.
- Fixed an issue where Docker Desktop auto-start was not being disabled properly on some machines.
- Fixed a container start error when a container has more than one port with an arbitrary or not-yet-configured external port number. For example, `docker run -p 80 -p 443 nginx`). Fixes [docker/for-win#4935](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/4935) and [docker/compose#6998](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6998).
- Fixed an issue which caused Docker Desktop to crash when resetting to factory defaults while running Windows containers.
- Fixed multiple issues related to Fast Startup.
- Injected Docker CLI, CLI plugins, Docker Compose, Notary, and kubectl into WSL distros when Docker Desktop WSL integration is enabled.

This release contains a Kubernetes upgrade. Note that your local Kubernetes cluster will be reset after installation.

### Upgrades

- [Kubernetes 1.15.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.15.5)
- [Docker Compose 1.25.0-rc4](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.25.0-rc4)
- Linux kernel 4.19.76

### New

- **Docker Desktop Dashboard:** The new Docker Desktop **Dashboard** provides a user-friendly interface which enables you to interact with containers and applications, and manage the lifecycle of your applications directly from the UI. In addition, it allows you to access the logs, view container details, and monitor resource utilization to explore the container behavior.

  To access the Dashboard UI, select the Docker menu from the system tray and then click **Dashboard**.

- **WSL 2 backend:** The new Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend replaces the Docker Desktop WSL 2 Tech Preview. The WSL 2 backend architecture introduces support for Kubernetes, provides an updated Docker daemon, offers VPN-friendly networking, and additional features. For more information, see [Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend](../windows/wsl.md).

- **New file sharing implementation:** Docker Desktop introduces a new file sharing implementation which uses gRPC, FUSE, and Hypervisor sockets instead of Samba, CIFS, and Hyper-V networking. The new implementation  offers improved I/O performance. Additionally, when using the new file system:

  - Users don't have to expose the Samba port, and therefore do not experience issues related to IT firewall or the drive-sharing policy.
  - There is no need to provide user credentials to Docker Desktop. File access rights are automatically enforced when accessing mounted folders through containers.

  > To switch back to the Samba file system:
  >
  > From the Docker menu, select **Settings** > **Command line**, and then clear the **Enable experimental features** check box. Alternatively, install a Docker Desktop Stable release.

### Known issues

- When you start a Docker Compose application and then start a Docker App which has the same name as the Compose application, Docker Desktop displays only one application on the Dashboard. However, when you expand the application, containers that belong to both applications are displayed on the Dashboard.

- When you deploy a Docker App with multiple containers on Kubernetes, Docker Desktop displays each Pod as an application on the Dashboard.

 - The **Restart** and **Reset** options are now available on the **Troubleshoot** menu. 

#### Bug fixes and minor changes

 - Changed the host's kubernetes context to ensure `docker run -v .kube:kube ... kubectl` works.
 - Restricted the `cluster-admin` role on local Kubernetes cluster to `kube-system` namespace.
 - Fixed Kubernetes installation with VPNkit subnet.
 - Fixed an issue where Docker Desktop restarts when a user logs out of Windows and logs back in, which results in retaining the    
   exported ports on containers.

- Migration from Docker Toolbox can fail sometimes. If this happens, the workaround is to restart the application.

- Docker needs to open ports on the firewall, which can activate a firewall alert dialog. Users should allow the ports to be opened.

- The application was upgraded to 64 bits. The installation path changed to `C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker`. If users have PowerShell/Cmd windows already open before the update, they might need to close them to catch the new PATH. In some cases, users need to log off and on again.

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed an issue which caused Docker Desktop Dashboard to attempt connecting to all exposed ports inside a container. Fixes [docker/for-win#5903](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5903).
- Kubernetes: Persistent volumes created by claims are now stored in the virtual machine. Fixes [docker/for-win#5665](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5665).
- Fixed an issue which caused Docker Desktop to hang when users tried to reset to factory defaults.
- Fixed a file sharing issue that caused Docker Desktop to lock random files. Fixes [docker/for-win#5624](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5624) and [docker/for-win#5575](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5575).

### Known issues

- Some CLI commands fail if you are running Docker Desktop in the experimental Linux Containers on Windows (LCOW) mode. As alternatives, we recommend running either traditional Linux containers, or the experimental [WSL backend](../windows/wsl.md).
- It is not possible to resize the disk image using the Docker Desktop **Settings** UI. If you would like to update the size of the disk image (for example, to 128 GB), run the following command in PowerShell:

  ```powershell
  Resize-VHD -Path 'C:\ProgramData\DockerDesktop\vm-data\DockerDesktop.vhdx' -SizeBytes 128gb
  ```

- Fixed handling of shared volumes with relative paths in `docker-compose.yml`. Fixes [docker/for-win#5516](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5516).
- Fixed handling of shared volumes where the path case (uppercase / lowercase) did not exactly match the host. Fixes [docker/for-win#5516](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5516).
- Fixed an issue where changing a file in the Windows file system did not update the file within the container. Fixes [docker/for-win#5530](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5530) and [docker/for-win#5550](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5550).
- Fixed an issue that prevented users from sharing drives and sometimes incorrectly prompted users to enter file system credentials. Fixes [docker/for-win#5567](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5567).
- Fixed an issue which prevented users from mounting nested volumes. Fixes [docker/for-win#5540](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5540).
- Fixed a file synchronization issue on bind mounts. Fixes [docker/for-win#5533](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5533).
- Fixed an issue where timestamps were reset to zero on files within shared volumes. Fixes [docker/for-win#5528](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5528) and [docker/for-win#5543](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5543).
- Fixed a bug which caused Docker Desktop to fail when sharing file paths longer than 260 characters. Fixes [docker/for-win#5572](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5572).
- Fixed an issue where some users were unable to start a container if there is a symlink in a shared volume. Fixes [docker/for-win#5582](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5582).
- Fixed a bug where users were unable to modify the **Manual proxy configuration** settings through the Docker Desktop UI. Fixes [docker/for-win#5606](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5606) and [docker/for-win#5548](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5548).
- Fixed an issue where the Docker Desktop UI failed to start if the `no_proxy` environment variable has an entry that starts with a dot (.). Fixes [docker/for-win/5551](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5551).
- Fixed a bug that did not allow users to access the Docker Desktop UI on machines with a policy preventing access to the Windows registry. Fixes [docker/for-win#5536](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5536).
- Fixed an issue where disabling the WSL2 integration and re-enabling it later resulted in broken symlinks. Fixes [docker/for-win#5613](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5613).

- Fixed a bug where running the command `DockerCli.exe -SharedDrives` failed to display a list of drives that are shared. Fixes [docker/for-win#5625](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5625).
- Starting with Docker Desktop 2.2.0.3, you must access all shared files using their original case. For example, if you have created a file called `test`, you must open it as `test`. Attempts to open the file as `Test` will fail with the error `No such file or directory`. For more information, see _Tips on shared drives, permissions, and volume mounts_ in [File sharing](../settings/windows.md#file-sharing).

### Known issues

- DockerNAT has been removed from Docker Desktop 2.2.0.0 as using an IP address to communicate from the host to a container is not a supported feature. To communicate from a container to the host, you must use the special DNS name `host.docker.internal`. We also recommend using ports to communicate from the host to a container. For more information, see [Networking](../networking.md#use-cases-and-workarounds-for-all-platforms).

  However, if your current setup relies on IP addresses for communication, you can use a temporary workaround to reinstate DockerNAT. To do this, open
  `C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\MobyLinux.ps1` and add `$SwitchName = "DockerNAT"` between line 175 and 176. Note that the temporary workaround to reinstate DockerNAT may be removed from future releases.
- Directory junctions in shared volumes pointing outside the shared volume do not work.
- It is currently not possible to rename open files within shared volumes.
- In some cases, Docker containers do not synchronize time with the host when the host machine is put to sleep.
- It is not possible to use `localhost` in the proxy settings. You can instead use `host.docker.internal` to work around this issue.

## Docker Desktop Community 2.2.0.0
2020-01-21

Docker Desktop 2.2.0.0 contains a Kubernetes upgrade. Your local Kubernetes cluster will be reset after installing this version.

### Upgrades

- [Docker Compose 1.25.2](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.25.2)
- [Kubernetes 1.15.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.15.5)
- Linux kernel 4.19.76
- [QEMU 4.0.1](https://github.com/docker/binfmt)

### New

- **Docker Desktop Dashboard:** The new Docker Desktop **Dashboard** provides a user-friendly interface which enables you to interact with containers and applications, and manage the lifecycle of your applications directly from the UI. In addition, it allows you to access the logs, view container details, and monitor resource utilization to explore the container behavior.
  For detailed information about the new Dashboard UI, see [Docker Desktop Dashboard](../index.md).

- **WSL 2 backend:** The experimental Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend architecture introduces support for Kubernetes, provides an updated Docker daemon, offers VPN-friendly networking, and additional features. For more information, see [Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend](../windows/wsl.md).

- **New file sharing implementation:** Docker Desktop introduces a new file sharing implementation that replaces Samba, CIFS, and Hyper-V networking. The new implementation  offers improved I/O performance. Additionally, when using the new file system:

  - Users don't have to expose the Samba port, and therefore do not experience issues related to IT firewall or drive-sharing policy.
  - There is no need to provide user credentials to Docker Desktop. File access rights are automatically enforced when accessing mounted folders through containers.

    For more information, see the blog post [New file sharing implementation in Docker Desktop Windows](https://www.docker.com/blog/new-filesharing-implementation-in-docker-desktop-windows/).

- Added the **WSL Integration** option in **Settings** > **Resources** to select WSL 2 distributions. This option will be visible only after enabling WSL 2 on your machine.
- Introduced a new user interface for the Docker Desktop **Settings** menu.
- The Restart, Reset, and Uninstall options are now available on the **Troubleshoot** menu.
- Added the ability to start and stop existing Compose-based applications and view combined logs in the Docker Desktop **Dashboard** UI.

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Enabled Windows features such as Hyper-V and Containers during installation, thereby reducing the need for another restart after installation.
- Added support for `Expect: 100-continue` headers in the Docker API proxy. Some HTTP clients such as `curl` send this header when the payload is large, for example, when creating containers. Fixes [moby/moby#39693](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/39693).
- Added a loading overlay to the **Settings** and **Troubleshoot** windows to prevent editing conflicts.
- Deactivated the **Reset Kubernetes** button when Kubernetes is not activated.
- Improved the navigation in **Settings** and **Troubleshoot** UI.
- Docker Machine is no longer included in the Docker Desktop installer. You can download it separately from the [Docker Machine releases](https://github.com/docker/machine/releases) page.
- Docker Desktop now automatically restarts after an update.
- Fixed an issue where Docker Desktop auto-start was not being disabled properly on some machines.
- Fixed a container start error when a container has more than one port with an arbitrary or not-yet-configured external port number. For example, `docker run -p 80 -p 443 nginx`). Fixes [docker/for-win#4935](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/4935) and [docker/compose#6998](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6998).
- Fixed an issue which caused Docker Desktop to crash when resetting to factory defaults while running Windows containers.
- Fixed multiple issues related to Fast Startup.
- Docker Desktop now supports `inotify` events on shared filesystems.
- Docker Desktop startup is now more reliable and does not clash with host firewall software.
- Fixed a rare issue that caused to Docker Desktop to crash with the error `Unable to stop Hyper-V VM: Cannot validate argument on parameter 'SwitchName'. The argument is null or empty.`
- Fixed a bug that caused a rare crash when uninstalling Docker Desktop.
- Fixed an issue that caused Docker Desktop to fail on startup when there is an incomplete Kubernetes config file.
- Fixed various stability issues.

### Known issues

- When you start a Docker Compose application and then start a Docker App which has the same name as the Compose application, Docker Desktop displays only one application on the Dashboard. However, when you expand the application, containers that belong to both applications are displayed on the Dashboard.
- When you deploy a Docker App with multiple containers on Kubernetes, Docker Desktop displays each Pod as an application on the Dashboard.
- WSL 2 requires Windows 10 Insider Preview build 19018 or greater.
- The Dashboard stops updating when you switch the container mode between Linux and Windows. To work around this issue, close and reopen the Dashboard.
- The new gRPC FUSE file sharing implementation does not support connecting to new drives (for example, USB drives) added after Docker Desktop starts. If you would like to share the new drive in Docker Desktop, you must quit Docker Desktop and then start the application to refresh the list of drives in Settings.
- Sharing files from virtual drives created by `ImDisk Toolkit` does not work.

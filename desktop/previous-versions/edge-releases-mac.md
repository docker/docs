- Fixed the VM debug shell used for low-level debugging.
- Fixed compatibility with Go 1.15 clients. See [docker/for-mac#4855](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4855).
- Avoid exposing `/host_mnt` paths in `docker container inspect` and `docker volume inspect`. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4859](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4859).
- Fixed container logs lagging under heavy load. See [docker/for-win#8216](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/8216).

### Known issues

- The `clock_gettime64` system call returns `EPERM` rather than `ENOSYS`
in i386 images. To work around this issue, disable `seccomp` by using 
the `--privileged` flag. See [docker/for-win#8326](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/8326).

### New

- The **Images** view on the Dashboard now allows you to interact with images on Docker Hub. You can now pull a remote repository with specific tags from Docker Hub, or view the details of the repository on the Docker Hub page. To access the new Images view, from the Docker menu, select **Dashboard** > **Images**.

- Docker Desktop now enables BuildKit by default after a reset to factory defaults. To revert to the old docker build experience, go to **Preferences** > **Docker Engine** and then disable the BuildKit feature.

- Docker Desktop now uses **gRPC-FUSE** for file sharing by default. This has much faster file sharing and uses much less CPU than `osxfs`, especially when there are lots of file events on the host. To switch back to `osxfs`, go to **Preferences** > **General** and disable gRPC-FUSE.

### Upgrades

- [Go 1.14.7](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone:Go1.14.7+label:CherryPickApproved)
- [Docker ECS integration v1.0.0-beta.5](https://github.com/docker/ecs-plugin/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.5)

- [Docker ACI integration 0.1.12](https://github.com/docker/aci-integration-beta/releases/tag/v0.1.12)

### Removal

- The Mutagen file sync feature that we have been experimenting with in recent Edge releases has been removed. Thanks to everyone who has provided feedback on this feature. We are reconsidering how to integrate it based on the feedback we have received so far.

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Moved **Dashboard** to the top of the whale menu.
- Improved the error handling when `dockerd` crashes.
- Fixed minor bugs in the **Images** view.

- [Docker Compose 1.26.2](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.26.2)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Compose-on-Kubernetes is no longer included in the Docker Desktop installer. You can download it separately from the compose-on-kubernetes [release page](https://github.com/docker/compose-on-kubernetes/releases).
- Fixed an incompatibility between `hyperkit` and `osquery` which resulted in excessive `hyperkit` CPU usage. See [docker/for-mac#3499](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3499#issuecomment-639140844)
- Docker Desktop now respects consistency flags `cached`, `delegated`, `consistent` even when in a list of options (for example, `z,delegated`). See [docker/for-mac#4718](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4718).
- Docker Desktop now implements the shared volume flag `:delegated` by automatically setting up a two-way file sync with Mutagen.

### New

Docker Desktop introduces a directory caching mechanism to greatly improve disk performance in containers. This feature uses [mutagen.io](https://mutagen.io/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"} to sync files between the host and the containers and benefits from native disk performance.

We appreciate you trying out an early version of the Mutagen file sync feature. Please let us know your feedback by creating an issue in the [Docker Desktop for Mac GitHub](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"} repository with the `Mutagen` label.

### Upgrades

- [Docker Compose 1.26.0-rc4](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.26.0-rc4)
- Upgrade to Qemu 4.2.0, add Risc-V support

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Fixed a performance regression when using shared volumes in 2.2.0.5. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4423](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4423).
- Fixed containers logs in Docker Desktop **Dashboard** which were sometimes truncated. Fixes [docker/for-win#5954](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5954).

### Upgrades

- [Docker 19.03.8](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce/releases/tag/v19.03.8)
- [Docker Compose 1.26.0-rc3](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.26.0-rc3)
- [Linux 4.19.76](https://hub.docker.com/layers/docker/for-desktop-kernel/4.19.76-4e5d9e5f3bde0abf236f97e4a81b029ae0f5f6e7-amd64/images/sha256-11dc0f6ee3187088219ba1463ebb378f5093a7d98f176ddfd62dd6b741c2dd2d?context=repo)

### New

- Docker Desktop introduces a new onboarding tutorial upon first startup. The Quick Start tutorial guides users to get started with Docker in a few easy steps. It includes a simple exercise to build an example Docker image, run it as a container, push and save the image to Docker Hub.

### Bug fixes and minor changes

> Docker Desktop Edge 2.2.3.0 fixes 7 issues reported on the [docker/for-mac](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues) GitHub repository.

- Reduced the size of the Docker Desktop installer from 710 MB to 445 MB.
- Removed dangling `/usr/local/bin/docker-machine` symlinks which avoids custom installs of `docker-machine` being accidentally deleted in future upgrades. Note that if you have installed Docker Machine manually, then the install might have followed the symlink and installed Docker Machine in `/Applications/Docker.app`. In this case, you must manually reinstall Docker Machine after installing this version of Docker Desktop. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4208](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4208).
- Fixed a bug where the Docker UI could be started without the engine.
- Switched from `ahci-hd` to `virtio-blk` to avoid an AHCI deadlock, see [moby/hyperkit#94](https://github.com/moby/hyperkit/issues/94) and [docker/for-mac#1835](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/1835).
- Capturing diagnostics is now faster and easier.
- Fixed an issue where a container port could not be exposed on a specific host IP. See [docker/for-mac#4209](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4209).
- Kubernetes: Persistent volumes created by claims are now stored in the virtual machine. Fixes [docker/for-win#5665](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5665).
- Removed port probing from dashboard, just unconditionally showing links to ports that should be available. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4264](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4264).

### Known issues

- Loopback and unspecified IPv6 addresses (`::` and `::1`) within a container do not currently work. Some web servers and other programs may be using these addresses in their configuration files.

- [Docker Compose 1.25.0-rc4](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.25.0-rc4)
- Linux kernel 4.19.76

### New

**Docker Desktop Dashboard:** The new Docker Desktop **Dashboard** provides a user-friendly interface which enables you to interact with containers and applications, and manage the lifecycle of your applications directly from the UI. In addition, it allows you to access the logs, view container details, and monitor resource utilization to explore the container behavior.

To access the new Dashboard UI, select the Docker menu from the Mac menu bar and then click **Dashboard**.

### Bug fixes and minor changes

Fixed an issue that caused VMs running on older hardware with macOS Catalina to fail on startup with the error `processor does not support desired secondary processor-based controls`.

### Known issues

- When you start a Docker Compose application and then start a Docker App which has the same name as the Compose application, Docker Desktop displays only one application on the Dashboard. However, when you expand the application, containers that belong to both applications are displayed on the Dashboard.

- When you deploy a Docker App with multiple containers on Kubernetes, Docker Desktop displays each Pod as an application on the Dashboard.

* Bug fixes and minor changes
  - Fix login into private repository with certificate issue. [docker/for-mac#2201](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2201)

* New
  - For systems running APFS on SSD on High Sierra, use `raw` format virtual machine disks by default. This increases disk throughput (from 320MiB/sec to 600MiB/sec in `dd` on a 2015 MacBook Pro) and disk space handling.
  Existing disks are kept in qcow format, if you want to switch to raw format you need to "Reset to factory defaults". To query the space usage of the file, use a command like:
  `$ cd ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/com.docker.driver.amd64-linux/`
  `$ ls -ls Docker.raw`
  `3944768 -rw-r--r--@ 1 user  staff  68719476736 Nov 16 11:19 Docker.raw`
  The first number (`3944768`) is the allocated space in blocks; the larger number `68719476736` is the maximum total amount of space the file may consume in future in bytes.

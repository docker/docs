- File sharing: generated `ATTRIB` inotify events as well as `MODIFY`. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4962](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4962).
- File sharing: returned `EOPNOTSUPP` from `fallocate` for unsupported modes. Fixes `minio`. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4964](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4964).
- File sharing: fixed a possible premature file handle close.
- When sharing Linux directories (`/var`, `/bin`, etc) with containers, Docker Desktop avoids watching paths in the host file system.
- When sharing a file into a container (e.g. `docker run -v ~/.gitconfig`) Docker Desktop does not watch the parent directory. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4981](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4981), [docker/for-mac#4975](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4975).

## Docker Desktop Community 2.4.0.0
2020-09-30

> Download Docker Desktop

> [Mac with Intel chip](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/stable/48506/Docker.dmg){: .accept-eula }

Docker Desktop 2.4.0.0 contains a Kubernetes upgrade. Your local Kubernetes cluster will be reset after installing this version.

### New

- [Docker Compose CLI - 0.1.18](https://github.com/docker/compose-cli), enabling use of volumes with Compose and the Cloud through ECS and ACI.
- Docker introduces the new Images view in the Docker Dashboard. The images view allows users to view the Hub images, pull them and manage their local images on disk including cleaning up unwanted and unused images. To access the new Images view, from the Docker menu, select **Dashboard** > **Images**.
- Docker Desktop now enables BuildKit by default after a reset to factory defaults. To revert to the old `docker build` experience, go to **Preferences** > **Docker Engine** and then disable the BuildKit feature.
- [Amazon ECR Credential Helper](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-credential-helper/releases/tag/v0.4.0)
- Docker Desktop now uses much less CPU when there are lots of file events on the host and when running Kubernetes, see [docker/roadmap#12](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/12).
- Docker Desktop now uses gRPC-FUSE for file sharing by default. This uses much less CPU than osxfs, especially when there are lots of file events on the host. To switch back to `osxfs`, go to **Preferences** > **General** and disable gRPC-FUSE.

### Upgrades

- [Docker 19.03.13](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce/releases/tag/v19.03.13)
- [Docker Compose 1.27.4](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.27.4)
- [Go 1.14.7](https://github.com/golang/go/releases/tag/go1.14.7)
- [Alpine 3.12](https://alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.12.0-released.html)
- [Kubernetes 1.18.8](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.18.8)
- [Qemu 4.2.0](https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=tag;h=1e4aa2dad329852aa6c3f59cefd65c2c2ef2062c)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Docker Desktop on macOS 10.13 is now deprecated.
- Removed the legacy Kubernetes context `docker-for-desktop`. The context `docker-desktop` should be used instead. Fixes [docker/for-win#5089](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5089) and [docker/for-mac#4089](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5089).
- Adding the application to the dock and clicking on it will launch the container view if Docker is already running.
- Added support for emulating Risc-V via Qemu 4.2.0.
- Removed file descriptor limit (`setrlimit`) of `10240`. We now rely on the kernel to impose limits via `kern.maxfiles` and `kern.maxfilesperproc`.
- Fixed a Mac CPU usage bug by removing the serial console from `hyperkit`, see [docker/roadmap#12]( https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/12#issuecomment-663163280). To open a shell in the VM use either `nc -U ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/debug-shell.sock`.
- Copy container logs without ansi colors to clipboard. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4786](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4786).
- Fixed automatic start on log in. See [docker/for-mac#4877] and [docker/for-mac#4890].
- Fixed bug where the application won't start if the username is too long.
- Fixed a bug where adding directories like `/usr` to the filesharing list prevents Desktop from starting. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4488](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4488)
- Fixed application startup if `hosts` is specified inside the Docker `daemon.json`. See [docker/for-win#6895](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/6895#issuecomment-637429117)
- Docker Desktop always flushes filesystem caches synchronously on container start. See [docker/for-mac#4943](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4943).
- Compose-on-Kubernetes is no longer included in the Docker Desktop installer. You can download it separately from the compose-on-kubernetes [release page](https://github.com/docker/compose-on-kubernetes/releases).

### Known issues

-  There is a known issue when using `docker-compose` with named volumes and gRPC FUSE: second and subsequent calls to `docker-compose up` will fail due to the volume path having the prefix `/host_mnt`. To work around this issue, switch back to `osxfs` in Settings. See [docker/for-mac#4859](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4859).
- There is a known issue when enabling Kubernetes where the settings UI fails to update the Kubernetes state. To work around this issue, close and re-open the window.
- There is a rare known issue when switching users where the images view continues to show the repositories of the previous user. To work around this issue, close and re-open the window.

### New

- The new Cloud integration in Docker CLI makes it easy to run containers in the cloud using either Amazon ECS or Microsoft ACI. For more information, see [Deploying Docker containers on ECS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/context/ecs-integration/) and [Deploying Docker containers on Azure](https://docs.docker.com/engine/context/aci-integration/).

### Upgrades

- [Docker Compose 1.27.2](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.27.2)
- [Cloud integration v0.1.15](https://github.com/docker/aci-integration-beta/releases/tag/v0.1.15)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Fixed automatic start on log in. See [docker/for-mac#4877](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4877) and [docker/for-mac#4890](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4890)

### Known issues

- The `clock_gettime64` system call returns `EPERM` rather than `ENOSYS`
  in i386 images. To work around this issue, disable `seccomp` by using
  the `--privileged` flag. See [docker/for-win#8326](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/8326).

- Fixed bug where containers disappeared from the UI when Kubernetes context is invalid. Fixes [docker/for-win#6037](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/6037).
- Fixed a file descriptor leak in `vpnkit-bridge`. Fixes [docker/for-win#5841](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5841).
- Added a link to the Edge channel from the UI.
- Made the embedded terminal resizable.
- Fixed a bug where diagnostic upload would fail if the username contained spaces.
- Fixed a bug where the Docker UI could be started without the engine.
- Switched from `ahci-hd` to `virtio-blk` to avoid an AHCI deadlock, see [moby/hyperkit#94](https://github.com/moby/hyperkit/issues/94) and [docker/for-mac#1835](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/1835).
- Fixed an issue where a container port could not be exposed on a specific host IP. See [docker/for-mac#4209](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4209).
- Removed port probing from dashboard, just unconditionally showing links to ports that should be available. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4264](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4264).
- Docker Desktop now shares `/var/folders` by default as it stores per-user temporary files and caches.
- Ceph support has been removed from Docker Desktop to save disk space.

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Removed dangling `/usr/local/bin/docker-machine` symlinks which avoids custom installs of  Docker Machine being accidentally deleted in future upgrades. Note that if you have installed Docker Machine manually, then the install might have followed the symlink and installed Docker Machine in `/Applications/Docker.app`. In this case, you must manually reinstall Docker Machine after installing this version of Docker Desktop. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4208](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4208).

- Linux kernel 4.19.76
- [QEMU 4.0.1](https://github.com/docker/binfmt)

### New

- **Docker Desktop Dashboard:** The new Docker Desktop **Dashboard** provides a user-friendly interface which enables you to interact with containers and applications, and manage the lifecycle of your applications directly from the UI. In addition, it allows you to access the logs, view container details, and monitor resource utilization to explore the container behavior.
  For detailed information about the new Dashboard UI, see [Docker Desktop Dashboard](../dashboard.md).

- Introduced a new user interface for the Docker Desktop **Preferences** menu.
- The Restart, Reset, and Uninstall options are now available on the **Troubleshoot** menu.
- Added the ability to start and stop existing Compose-based applications and view combined logs in the Docker Desktop **Dashboard** UI.

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Added missing completions for the `fish` shell for Docker Compose. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3795](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3795).
- Fixed a bug that did not allow users to copy and paste text in the **Preferences** > **Daemon** window. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3798](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3798).
- Added support for `Expect: 100-continue` headers in the Docker API proxy. Some HTTP clients such as `curl` send this header when the payload is large, for example, when creating containers. Fixes [moby/moby#39693](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/39693).
- Added a loading overlay to the **Settings** and **Troubleshoot** windows to prevent editing conflicts.
- Deactivated the **Reset Kubernetes** button when Kubernetes is not activated.
- Improved the navigation in **Settings** and **Troubleshoot** UI.
- Fixed a bug in the UEFI boot menu that sometimes caused Docker Desktop to hang during restart. Fixes [docker/for-mac#2655](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2655) and [docker/for-mac#3921](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3921).
- Docker Desktop now allows users to access the host’s SSH agent inside containers. Fixes [docker/for-mac#410](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/410)
- Docker Machine is no longer included in the Docker Desktop installer. You can download it separately from the [Docker Machine releases](https://github.com/docker/machine/releases) page.
- Fixed an issue that caused VMs running on older hardware with macOS Catalina to fail on startup with the error `processor does not support desired secondary processor-based controls`.
- Fixed port forwarding when containers are using `overlay` networks.
- Fixed a container start error when a container has more than one port with an arbitrary or not-yet-configured external port number. For example, `docker run -p 80 -p 443 nginx`. Fixes [docker/for-win#4935](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/4935) and [docker/compose#6998](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6998).
- Fixed an issue that occurs when sharing overlapping directories.
- Fixed a bug that prevented users from changing the location of the VM disk image.
- Docker Desktop does not inject `inotify` events on directories anymore as these can cause mount points to disappear inside containers. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3976](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3976).
- Fixed an issue that caused Docker Desktop to fail on startup when there is an incomplete Kubernetes config file.
- Fixed an issue where attempts to log into Docker through Docker Desktop could sometimes fail with the `Incorrect authentication credentials` error. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4010](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4010).

### Known issues

- When you start a Docker Compose application and then start a Docker App which has the same name as the Compose application, Docker Desktop displays only one application on the Dashboard. However, when you expand the application, containers that belong to both applications are displayed on the Dashboard.

- When you deploy a Docker App with multiple containers on Kubernetes, Docker Desktop displays each Pod as an application on the Dashboard.

### New

* Selecting the ‘Experimental features’ checkbox in the Daemon **Preferences** menu turns on experimental features for Docker daemon and Docker CLI.
* Improved the reliability of `com.docker.osxfs trace` performance profiling command. Users can now run the `com.docker.osxfs trace --summary` option for a high-level summary of operations, instead of receiving a trace of all operations.
* Docker Desktop now supports large lists of DNS resource records on Mac.  Fixes [docker/for-mac#2160](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2160#issuecomment-431571031).

### Experimental

> Experimental features provide early access to future product functionality. These features are intended for testing and feedback only as they may change between releases without warning or can be removed entirely from a future release. Experimental features must not be used in production environments. Docker does not offer support for experimental features.

Docker Desktop Community 2.1.0.0 contains the following experimental features.

* Docker App: Docker App is a CLI plugin that helps configure, share, and install applications. For more information, see [Working with Docker App](/app/working-with-app/).
* Docker Buildx: Docker Buildx is a CLI plugin for extended build capabilities with BuildKit. For more information, see [Working with Docker Buildx](/buildx/working-with-buildx/).

### Bug fixes and minor changes

* Docker Desktop now allows users to expose privileged UDP ports. [docker/for-mac#3775](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3775)
* Fixed an issue where running some Docker commands can fail if you are not using Credential Helpers. [docker/for-mac#3785](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3785)
* Changed the host's kubernetes context so that `docker run -v .kube:kube ... kubectl` works.
* Restricted the `cluster-admin` role on local Kubernetes cluster to `kube-system` namespace.
* Reduced the VM startup time. swap is not created every time a virtual machine boots.
* Fixed Kubernetes installation with VPNkit subnet.
* Fixed a bug where the process output was not redirected to stdout when gathering diagnostics on Windows, which sometimes resulted in a crash.
* Added `/etc/machine-id` to the virtual machine. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3554](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3554).
* Docker Desktop does not send DNS queries for `docker-desktop.<domain>` every 10s. It now relies on the host’s DNS domain search order rather than trying to replicate it inside the VM.
* Removed the ability to log in using email address as a username as the Docker command line does not support this.
* Docker Desktop now allows running a Docker registry inside a container. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3611](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3611).
* Fixed a stability issue with the DNS resolver.
* Docker Desktop truncates UDP DNS responses which are over 512 bytes in sizes.
* Fixed port 8080 that was used on localhost when starting Kubernetes. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3522](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3522).
* Improved error messaging: Docker Desktop does not prompt users to run diagnostics, or to reset to factory default when it is not appropriate.
* Kubernetes: Docker Desktop now uses the default maximum number of pods for kubelet. [docker/for-mac#3453](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3453).
* Fixed DockerHelper crash. [docker/for-mac#3470](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3470).
* Fixed binding of privileged ports with specified IP. [docker/for-mac#3464](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3464)
* Fixed service log collection in diagnostics.
* Docker Desktop now gathers `/etc/hosts` to help with diagnostics.
* When two services have a common exposed port, Docker Desktop now exposes the available ports for the second service. [docker/for-mac#3438](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3438).
* Docker Desktop ensures localhost resolves to 127.0.0.1. This is related to [docker/for-mac#2990](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2990#issuecomment-443097942), [docker/for-mac#3383](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3383).

- VHDX file containing images and non-host mounted volumes can be moved
  (using "advanced" tab in the UI)
- Support for arm, aarch64, ppc64le architectures using qemu
- TRIM support for disk (shrinks virtual disk)
- Virtual machine's time synchronization is forced after the host wakes from sleep mode
- Docker Experimental mode can be toggled

**Bug fixes and minor changes**

- Improved Proxy UI
- Improvements to Logging and Diagnostics
- About Box is now copy/paste enabled
- Improvements in drive sharing code
- Optimized boot process
- Trend Micro Office Scan made the API proxy think no drive was shared
- Show a link to the virtualization documentation
- Always remove the disk on factory reset
- VPNKit: Improved diagnostics
- VPNKit: Forwarded UDP datagrams have correct source port numbers
- VPNKit: If one request fails, allow other concurrent requests to succeed.
  For example this allows IPv4 servers to work even if IPv6 is broken.
- VPNKit: Fix bug which could cause the connection tracking to
  underestimate the number of active connections
- VPNKit: add a local cache of DNS responses

>**Important Note**:
>
> The auto-update function in Beta 21 cannot install this update. To install the latest beta manually if you are still on Beta 21, download the installer here:

> This problem is fixed as of Beta 23 for subsequent auto-updates.

**New**

* Docker machine 0.8.1
* Linux kernel 4.4.20
* aufs 20160905

**Bug fixes and minor changes**

**General**

* Uploading a diagnostic now shows a proper status message in the Settings

* Docker stops asking to import from the Toolbox after an upgrade

* Docker can now import from the Toolbox just after HyperV is activated

* Added more debug information to the diagnostics

**File sharing**

* Set `cifs` version to 3.02

* VnpKit: reduce the number of sockets used by UDP NAT, reduce the probability

* `slirp`: reduce the number of sockets used by UDP NAT, reduce the probability that NAT rules time out earlier than expected

* Fixed password handling for host file system sharing

**Hyper-V**

### New

**Dev Environments Preview**: Dev Environments enable you to seamlessly collaborate with your team members without moving between Git branches to get your code onto your team members' machines. When using Dev Environments, you can share your in-progress work with your team members in just one click, and without having to deal with any merge conflicts. For more information and for instructions on how to use Dev Environments, see [Development Environments Preview](../dev-environments/index.md).

### Upgrades

- [Compose V2 beta 6](https://github.com/docker/compose-cli/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta.6)

For more information and for instructions on how to use Dev Environments, see [Development Environments Preview](../dev-environments/index.md).

**Compose V2 beta**: Docker Desktop now includes the beta version of Compose V2, which supports the `docker compose` command as part of the Docker CLI. While `docker-compose` is still supported and maintained, Compose V2 implementation relies directly on the compose-go bindings which are maintained as part of the specification. The compose command in the Docker CLI supports most of the `docker-compose` commands and flags. It is expected to be a drop-in replacement for `docker-compose`. There are a few remaining flags that have yet to be implemented, see the [docker-compose compatibility list](../../compose/cli-command-compatibility.md) for more information about the flags that are supported in the new compose command. If you run into any problems with Compose V2, you can easily switch back to Compose v1 by either by making changes in Docker Desktop **Experimental** Settings, or by running the command `docker-compose disable-v2`. Let us know your feedback on the new ‘compose’ command by creating an issue in the [Compose-CLI](https://github.com/docker/compose-cli/issues) GitHub repository.

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Fixed a link to the policy that provides details on how Docker handles the uploaded diagnostics data. Fixes [docker/for-mac#5741](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5741)

### New

Docker Desktop is now available for Apple silicon as well as Intel chips. This enables developers with their choice of local development environments, and extends development pipelines for ARM-based applications. For more information, see [Docker Desktop for Apple silicon](../mac/apple-silicon.md).

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Docker Desktop now ensures the permissions of `/dev/null` and other devices are correctly set to `0666` (`rw-rw-rw-`) inside `--privileged` containers. Fixes [docker/for-mac#5527](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5527)
- Fixed an issue that caused Docker Desktop to fail during startup when it is unable to establish a connection with Docker Hub in the backend. Fixes [docker/for-win#10896](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/10896)

- **Mac with Apple silicon**: Docker Desktop now reduces the idle CPU consumption.

### Known issues

**Apple silicon**

- `ping` from inside a container to the Internet does not work as expected. To test the network, we recommend using `curl` or `wget`. See [docker/for-mac#5322](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5322#issuecomment-809392861).
- Users may occasionally experience data drop when a TCP stream is half-closed.

### New

You can now specify when to download and install a Docker Desktop update. When an update becomes available, Docker Desktop displays an icon to indicate the availability of a newer version. You can download the update in the background whenever convenient. When the download is complete, all you need to do is to click Update and restart to install the latest update.

Developers who use Docker Desktop for professional development purposes may at times need to skip a specific update. For this reason, users with a paid Docker subscription can skip notifications for a particular update when a reminder appears.

For developers in IT managed environments, who don’t have administrative access to install updates to Docker Desktop, there is now an option in the Settings menu to opt out of notifications altogether for Docker Desktop updates if your Docker ID is part of a Team subscription.

- Docker Desktop uses iTerm2 to launch the terminal on the container if it is installed. Otherwise, it launches the default Terminal.App. [docker/roadmap#98](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/98)
- Add experimental support to use the new Apple Virtualization framework (requires macOS Big Sur 11.1 or later)
- BuildKit is now the default builder for all users, not just for new installations. To turn this setting off, go to **Preferences** > **Docker Engine** and add the following block to the Docker daemon configuration file:
```json
"features": {
    "buildkit": false
}
```

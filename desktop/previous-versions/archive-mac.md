  - Linux Kernel 4.9.93 with CEPH, DRBD, RBD, MPLS_ROUTING and MPLS_IPTUNNEL enabled

* New
  - Kubernetes Support. You can now run a single-node Kubernetes cluster from the "Kubernetes" Pane in Docker For Mac Preferences and use kubectl commands as well as docker commands. See [the Kubernetes section](../kubernetes.md)
  - Add an experimental SOCKS server to allow access to container networks, see [docker/for-mac#2670](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2670#issuecomment-372365274). Also see [docker/for-mac#2721](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2721)
  - Re-enable raw as the default disk format for users running macOS 10.13.4 and higher. Note this change only takes effect after a "reset to factory defaults" or "remove all data" (from the Whale menu -> Preferences -> Reset). Related to [docker/for-mac#2625](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2625)

* Bug fixes and minor changes
  - AUFS storage driver is deprecated in Docker Desktop and AUFS support will be removed in the next major release. You can continue with AUFS in Docker Desktop 18.06.x, but you will need to reset disk image (in Preferences > Reset menu) before updating to the next major update. You can check documentation to [save images](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/save/#examples) and [backup volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#backup-restore-or-migrate-data-volumes)
  - OS X El Captain 10.11 is deprecated in Docker Desktop. You will not be able to install updates after Docker Desktop 18.06.x. We recommend upgrading to the latest version of macOS.
  - Fix bug which would cause VM logs to be written to RAM rather than disk in some cases, and the VM to hang. See [docker/for-mac#2984](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2984)

  - Virtual Machine default disk path is stored relative to $HOME. Fixes [docker/for-mac#2928](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2928), [docker/for-mac#1209](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/1209)
  - Use Simple NTP to minimise clock drift between the VM and the host. Fixes [docker/for-mac#2076](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2076)
  - Fix a race between calling stat on a file and calling close of a file descriptor referencing the file that could result in the stat failing with EBADF (often presented as "File not found"). Fixes [docker/for-mac#2870](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2870)
  - Do not allow install of Docker for Mac on macOS Yosemite 10.10, this version is not supported since Docker for Mac 17.09.0.
  - Fix button order in reset dialog windows. Fixes [docker/for-mac#2827](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2827)
  - Fix upgrade straight from pre-17.12 versions where Docker for Mac cannot restart once the upgrade has been performed. Fixes [docker/for-mac#2739](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2739)

> [Mac with Intel chip](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/21698/Docker.dmg){: .accept-eula }

* Upgrades
  - [Docker 17.12.0-ce](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce/releases/tag/v17.12.0-ce)
  - [Docker compose 1.18.0](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.18.0)
  - [Docker Machine 0.13.0](https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/tag/v0.13.0)
  - Linux Kernel 4.9.60

* New
  - VM entirely built with Linuxkit
  - VM disk size can be changed in disk preferences. (See [docker/for-mac#1037](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/1037))
  - For systems running APFS on SSD on High Sierra, use `raw` format VM disks by default. This improves disk throughput (from 320MiB/sec to 600MiB/sec in `dd` on a 2015 MacBook Pro) and disk space handling.
    Existing disks are kept in qcow format, if you want to switch to raw format you need to "Remove all data" or "Reset to factory defaults". See [Disk utilization](../mac/space.md)
  - DNS name `docker.for.mac.host.internal` should be used instead of `docker.for.mac.localhost` (still valid) for host resolution from containers, since since there is an RFC banning the use of subdomains of localhost. See  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-let-localhost-be-localhost-06.

* Bug fixes and minor changes
  - Display various component versions in About box.
  - Avoid VM reboot when changing host proxy settings.
  - Don't break HTTP traffic between containers by forwarding them via the external proxy. (See [docker/for-mac#981](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/981))
  - Filesharing settings are now stored in settings.json.
  - Daemon restart button has been moved to settings / Reset Tab.
  - Better VM state handling & error messages in case of VM crashes.
  - Fix login into private repository with certificate issue. (See [docker/for-mac#2201](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2201))

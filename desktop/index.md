Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install application for your Mac or Windows environment
that enables you to build and share containerized applications and microservices.

Docker Desktop includes:

- [Docker Engine](../engine/index.md)
- Docker CLI client
- [Docker Compose](../compose/index.md)
-[Docker Content Trust](../engine/security/trust/index.md)
- [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/)
- [Credential Helper](https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/).

Docker Desktop works with your choice of development tools and languages and
gives you access to a vast library of certified images and templates in
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). This enables development teams to extend
their environment to rapidly auto-build, continuously integrate, and collaborate
using a secure repository.

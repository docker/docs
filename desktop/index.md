Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install application for your Mac or Windows environment
that enables you to build and share containerized applications and microservices.
Docker Desktop includes [Docker Engine](../engine/index.md), Docker CLI client,
[Docker Compose](../compose/index.md), [Docker Content Trust](../engine/security/trust/index.md),
[Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/), and
[Credential Helper](https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/).

Docker Desktop works with your choice of development tools and languages and
gives you access to a vast library of certified images and templates in
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). This enables development teams to extend
their environment to rapidly auto-build, continuously integrate, and collaborate
using a secure repository.

Some of the key features of Docker Desktop include:

* Ability to containerize and share any application on any cloud platform, in multiple languages and frameworks
* Easy installation and setup of a complete Docker development environment
* Includes the latest version of Kubernetes
* Automatic updates to keep you up to date and secure
* On Windows, the ability to toggle between Linux and Windows Server environments to build applications
* Fast and reliable performance with native Windows Hyper-V virtualization
* Ability to work natively on Linux through WSL 2 on Windows machines
* Volume mounting for code and data, including file change notifications and easy access to running containers on the localhost network
* In-container development and debugging with supported IDEs

## Download and install

Docker Desktop is available for Mac and Windows. For download information, system requirements, and installation instructions, see:


* [Install Docker Desktop on Linux](linux/install.md)
* [Install Docker Desktop on Mac](mac/install.md)
* [Install Docker Desktop on Windows](windows/install.md)

For information about Docker Desktop licensing, see [Docker Desktop License Agreement](../subscription/index.md#docker-desktop-license-agreement).

## Sign in to Docker Desktop

After youâ€™ve successfully installed and started Docker Desktop, we recommend
that you authenticate using the **Sign in/Create ID** option from the Docker
menu.

Authenticated users get a higher pull rate limit compared to anonymous users. For example, if you are authenticated, you get 200 pulls per 6 hour period, compared to 100 pulls per 6 hour period per IP address for anonymous users. For more information, see [Download rate limit](../docker-hub/download-rate-limit.md).

In large enterprises where admin access is restricted, administrators can create
a `registry.json` file and deploy it to the developers' machines using a device
management software as part of the Docker Desktop installation process. Enforcing developers to authenticate through Docker Desktop also allows
administrators to set up guardrails using features such as
[Image Access Management](../docker-hub/image-access-management.md) which allows team
members to only have access to Trusted Content on Docker Hub, and pull only from
the specified categories of images. For more information, see
[Configure registry.json to enforce sign in](../docker-hub/configure-sign-in.md).

Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install application for your Mac or Windows environment
that enables you to build and share containerized applications and microservices.
Docker Desktop includes [Docker Engine](../engine/index.md), Docker CLI client,
[Docker Compose](../compose/index.md), [Docker Content Trust](../engine/security/trust/index.md),
[Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/), and 
[Credential Helper](https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/).

Docker Desktop works with your choice of development tools and languages and
gives you access to a vast library of certified images and templates in
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). This enables development teams to extend
their environment to rapidly auto-build, continuously integrate, and collaborate
using a secure repository.

Some of the key features of Docker Desktop include:

* Ability to containerize and share any application on any cloud platform, in multiple languages and frameworks
* Easy installation and setup of a complete Docker development environment
* Includes the latest version of Kubernetes
* Automatic updates to keep you up to date and secure
* On Windows, the ability to toggle between Linux and Windows Server environments to build applications
* Fast and reliable performance with native Windows Hyper-V virtualization
* Ability to work natively on Linux through WSL 2 on Windows machines
* Volume mounting for code and data, including file change notifications and easy access to running containers on the localhost network
* In-container development and debugging with supported IDEs

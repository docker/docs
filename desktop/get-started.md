## Quick Start Guide

  Once Docker Desktop is installed, the Quick Start Guide launches. It includes a simple exercise to build an example Docker image, run it as a container, push and save the image to Docker Hub.

   ![Docker Quick Start tutorial](images/docker-tutorial-linux.png)

To run the Quick Start Guide on demand, select ![whale menu](images/whale-x.svg){: .inline} and then choose **Quick Start Guide**.

For a more detailed guide, see [Get started](../get-started/index.md).

## Sign in to Docker Desktop

We recommend that you authenticate using the **Sign in/Create ID** option in the top-right corner of Docker Desktop.

Once logged in, you can access your Docker Hub repositories directly from Docker Desktop.

Authenticated users get a higher pull rate limit compared to anonymous users. For example, if you are authenticated, you get 200 pulls per 6 hour period, compared to 100 pulls per 6 hour period per IP address for anonymous users. For more information, see [Download rate limit](../docker-hub/download-rate-limit.md).

In large enterprises where admin access is restricted, administrators can create a registry.json file and deploy it to the developersâ€™ machines using a device management software as part of the Docker Desktop installation process. Enforcing developers to authenticate through Docker Desktop also allows administrators to set up guardrails using features such as [Image Access Management](../docker-hub/image-access-management.md) which allows team members to only have access to Trusted Content on Docker Hub, and pull only from the specified categories of images. For more information, see [Configure registry.json to enforce sign-in](../docker-hub/configure-sign-in.md).

### Two-factor authentication

Docker Desktop enables you to sign in to Docker Hub using two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security when accessing your Docker Hub account.

You must enable two-factor authentication in Docker Hub before signing into your Docker Hub account through Docker Desktop. For instructions, see [Enable two-factor authentication for Docker Hub](/docker-hub/2fa/).

After two-factor authentication is enabled:

1. Go to the Docker Desktop menu and then select **Sign in / Create Docker ID**.

2. Enter your Docker ID and password and click **Sign in**.

3. After you have successfully signed in, Docker Desktop prompts you to enter the authentication code. Enter the six-digit code from your phone and then click **Verify**.

### Credentials management for Linux users

Docker Desktop relies on [`pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"} to store credentials in gpg2-encrypted files.
Before signing in to Docker Hub from the Docker Dashboard or the Docker menu, you must initialize `pass`.
Docker Desktop displays a warning if you've not initialized `pass`.

You can intialize pass by using a gpg key. To generate a gpg key, run:

``` console
$ gpg --generate-key
...
GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Molly
Email address: molly@example.com
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Molly <molly@example.com>"

Change (N)ame, (E)mail, or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
...
pub   rsa3072 2022-03-31 [SC] [expires: 2024-03-30]
      7865BA9185AFA2C26C5B505669FC4F36530097C2
uid                      Molly <molly@example.com>
sub   rsa3072 2022-03-31 [E] [expires: 2024-03-30]
```

To initialize `pass`, run:

```console
molly@ubuntu:~$ pass init 7865BA9185AFA2C26C5B505669FC4F36530097C2
mkdir: created directory '/home/molly/.password-store/'
Password store initialized for 7865BA9185AFA2C26C5B505669FC4F36530097C2
```

Once `pass` is initialized, you can sign in on the Docker Dashboard and pull your private images.
When credentials are used by the Docker CLI or Docker Desktop, a user prompt may pop up for the password you set during the gpg key generation.

```console
$ docker pull molly/privateimage
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from molly/privateimage
3b9cc81c3203: Pull complete

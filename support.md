# Commercial Support Options

## How to get support

Purchasing a DTR License or Commercial Support subscription means your questions
and issues about DTR will receive prioritized support.
You can file a ticket through [email](mailto:support@docker.com) from your
company email address, or visit our [support site](https://support.docker.com).
In either case, you'll need to verify your email address, and then you can
communicate with the support team either by email or web interface.

**The availability of support depends on your [support subscription](https://www.docker.com/enterprise/support/)**

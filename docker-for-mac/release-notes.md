- Fixed a file descriptor leak in `vpnkit-bridge`. Fixes [docker/for-win#5841](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5841).
- Added a link to the Edge channel from the UI.
- Made the embedded terminal resizable.
- Fixed a bug where diagnostic upload would fail if the username contained spaces.
- Fixed a bug where the Docker UI could be started without the engine.
- Switched from `ahci-hd` to `virtio-blk` to avoid an AHCI deadlock, see [moby/hyperkit#94](https://github.com/moby/hyperkit/issues/94) and [docker/for-mac#1835](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/1835).

## Docker Desktop Community 2.2.0.5
2020-04-02

> [Download](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/43884/Docker.dmg)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Removed dangling `/usr/local/bin/docker-machine` symlinks which avoids custom installs of  Docker Machine being accidentally deleted in future upgrades. Note that if you have installed Docker Machine manually, then the install might have followed the symlink and installed Docker Machine in `/Applications/Docker.app`. In this case, you must manually reinstall Docker Machine after installing this version of Docker Desktop. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4208](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4208).

### Upgrades

- [Docker Compose 1.25.2](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.25.2)
- [Kubernetes 1.15.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.15.5)
- Linux kernel 4.19.76
- [QEMU 4.0.1](https://github.com/docker/binfmt)

### New

- **Docker Desktop Dashboard:** The new Docker Desktop **Dashboard** provides a user-friendly interface which enables you to interact with containers and applications, and manage the lifecycle of your applications directly from the UI. In addition, it allows you to access the logs, view container details, and monitor resource utilization to explore the container behavior.
For detailed information about the new Dashboard UI, see [Docker Desktop Dashboard](dashboard.md).

- Introduced a new user interface for the Docker Desktop **Preferences** menu.
- The Restart, Reset, and Uninstall options are now available on the **Troubleshoot** menu.
- Added the ability to start and stop existing Compose-based applications and view combined logs in the Docker Desktop **Dashboard** UI.

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Added missing completions for the `fish` shell for Docker Compose. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3795](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3795).
- Fixed a bug that did not allow users to copy and paste text in the **Preferences** > **Daemon** window. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3798](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3798).
- Added support for `Expect: 100-continue` headers in the Docker API proxy. Some HTTP clients such as `curl` send this header when the payload is large, for example, when creating containers. Fixes [moby/moby#39693](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/39693).
- Added a loading overlay to the **Settings** and **Troubleshoot** windows to prevent editing conflicts.
- Deactivated the **Reset Kubernetes** button when Kubernetes is not activated.
- Improved the navigation in **Settings** and **Troubleshoot** UI.
- Fixed a bug in the UEFI boot menu that sometimes caused Docker Desktop to hang during restart. Fixes [docker/for-mac#2655](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2655) and [docker/for-mac#3921](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3921).
- Docker Desktop now allows users to access the host’s SSH agent inside containers. Fixes [docker/for-mac#410](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/410)
- Docker Machine is no longer included in the Docker Desktop installer. You can download it separately from the [Docker Machine releases](https://github.com/docker/machine/releases) page.
- Fixed an issue that caused VMs running on older hardware with macOS Catalina to fail on startup with the error `processor does not support desired secondary processor-based controls`.
- Fixed port forwarding when containers are using `overlay` networks.
- Fixed a container start error when a container has more than one port with an arbitrary or not-yet-configured external port number. For example, `docker run -p 80 -p 443 nginx`. Fixes [docker/for-win#4935](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/4935) and [docker/compose#6998](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6998).
- Fixed an issue that occurs when sharing overlapping directories.
- Fixed a bug that prevented users from changing the location of the VM disk image.
- Docker Desktop does not inject `inotify` events on directories anymore as these can cause mount points to disappear inside containers. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3976](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3976).
- Fixed an issue that caused Docker Desktop to fail on startup when there is an incomplete Kubernetes config file.
- Fixed an issue where attempts to log into Docker through Docker Desktop could sometimes fail with the `Incorrect authentication credentials` error. Fixes [docker/for-mac#4010](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4010).

### Known issues

- When you start a Docker Compose application and then start a Docker App which has the same name as the Compose application, Docker Desktop displays only one application on the Dashboard. However, when you expand the application, containers that belong to both applications are displayed on the Dashboard.

- When you deploy a Docker App with multiple containers on Kubernetes, Docker Desktop displays each Pod as an application on the Dashboard.

* Docker Desktop does not send DNS queries for `docker-desktop.<domain>` every 10s. It now relies on the host’s DNS domain search order rather than trying to replicate it inside the VM.
* Removed the ability to log in using email address as a username as the Docker command line does not support this.
* Docker Desktop now allows running a Docker registry inside a container. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3611](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3611).
* Fixed a stability issue with the DNS resolver.
* Docker Desktop truncates UDP DNS responses which are over 512 bytes in sizes.
* Fixed port 8080 that was used on localhost when starting Kubernetes. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3522](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3522).
* Improved error messaging: Docker Desktop does not prompt users to run diagnostics, or to reset to factory default when it is not appropriate.
* Kubernetes: Docker Desktop now uses the default maximum number of pods for kubelet. [docker/for-mac#3453](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3453).
* Fixed DockerHelper crash. [docker/for-mac#3470](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3470).

- disk: make the "flush" behaviour configurable for database-like workloads. This works around a performance regression in 1.12.1.

**Networking**

- Proxy: Fixed application of system or custom proxy settings over container restart

- DNS: reduce the number of UDP sockets consumed on the host

- VPNkit: improve the connection-limiting code to avoid running out of sockets on the host

- UDP: handle diagrams bigger than 2035, up to the configured macOS kernel limit

- UDP: make the forwarding more robust; drop packets and continue rather than stopping

**File sharing**

- osxfs: Fixed the prohibition of chown on read-only or mode 0 files, (fixes
  [docker/for-mac#117](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/117),
  [docker/for-mac#263](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/263),
  [docker/for-mac#633](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/633))

- osxfs: Fixed race causing some reads to run forever

- osxfs: Fixed a simultaneous volume mount race which can result in a crash

**Moby**

- Increase default ulimit for memlock (fixes [docker/for-mac#801](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/801))

### Docker for Mac 2016-08-11 1.12.0-a

[Download](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/11213/Docker.dmg)

This bug fix release contains osxfs improvements. The fixed issues may have
been seen as failures with apt-get and npm in containers, missed inotify
events or unexpected unmounts.

**Bug fixes**

* osxfs: fixed an issue causing access to children of renamed directories to fail (symptoms: npm failures, apt-get failures)

* osxfs: fixed an issue causing some ATTRIB and CREATE inotify events to fail delivery and other inotify events to stop

* osxfs: fixed an issue causing all inotify events to stop when an ancestor directory of a mounted directory was mounted

* osxfs: fixed an issue causing volumes mounted under other mounts to spontaneously unmount

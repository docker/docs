## 0.9.0

{% include release-date.html date="2022-08-17" %} 

### New features

* Support for new [driver `remote`](building/drivers/remote.md) that you can use
  to connect to any already running BuildKit instance {% include github_issue.md repo="docker/buildx" number="1078" %}
  {% include github_issue.md repo="docker/buildx" number="1093" %} {% include github_issue.md repo="docker/buildx" number="1094" %}
  {% include github_issue.md repo="docker/buildx" number="1103" %} {% include github_issue.md repo="docker/buildx" number="1134" %}
  {% include github_issue.md repo="docker/buildx" number="1204" %}
* You can now load Dockerfile from standard input even when the build context is
  coming from external Git or HTTP URL {% include github_issue.md repo="docker/buildx" number="994" %}
* Build commands now support new the build context type `oci-layout://` for loading
  [build context from local OCI layout directories](../engine/reference/commandline/buildx_build.md#source-oci-layout).
  Note that this feature depends on an unreleased BuildKit feature and builder
  instance from `moby/buildkit:master` needs to be used until BuildKit v0.11 is
  released {% include github_issue.md repo="docker/buildx" number="1173" %}
* You can now use the new `--print` flag to run helper functions supported by the
  BuildKit frontend performing the build and print their results. You can use
  this feature in Dockerfile to show the build arguments and secrets that the
  current build supports with `--print=outline` and list all available
  Dockerfile stages with `--print=targets`. This feature is experimental for
  gathering early feedback and requires enabling `BUILDX_EXPERIMENTAL=1`
  environment variable. We plan to update/extend this feature in the future
  without keeping backward compatibility {% include github_issue.md repo="docker/buildx" number="1100" %}
  {% include github_issue.md repo="docker/buildx" number="1272" %}
* You can now use the new `--invoke` flag to launch interactive containers from
  build results for an interactive debugging cycle. You can reload these
  containers with code changes or restore them to an initial state from the
  special monitor mode. This feature is experimental for gathering early
  feedback and requires enabling `BUILDX_EXPERIMENTAL=1` environment variable.
  We plan to update/extend this feature in the future without enabling backward
  compatibility {% include github_issue.md repo="docker/buildx" number="1168" %}
  {% include github_issue.md repo="docker/buildx" number="1257" %} {% include github_issue.md repo="docker/buildx" number="1259" %}

  instance {% include github_issue.md repo="docker/buildx" number="998" %}

  files for compatibility {% include github_issue.md repo="docker/buildx" number="1261" %}
* Bake now supports Compose files with `cache_to` definition {% include github_issue.md repo="docker/buildx" number="1155" %}

  from different builders {% include github_issue.md repo="docker/buildx" number="1109" %}
* Docker driver can now detect if `dockerd` instance supports initially
  disabled Buildkit features like multi-platform images {% include github_issue.md repo="docker/buildx" number="1260" %}
  {% include github_issue.md repo="docker/buildx" number="1262" %}
* Compose files using targets with `.` in the name are now converted to use `_`
  so the selector keys can still be used in such targets {% include github_issue.md repo="docker/buildx" number="1011" %}

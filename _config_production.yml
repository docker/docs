# Set default options / metadata for some paths.

# Setting options here prevents having to repeat the same option in front-matter
# on every page. Avoid using wildcards, such as "path: engine/api/v1.*", as
# limitations in Jekyll cause those to introduce a _severe_ impact on build-time,
# affecting generation of (e.g.) sitemap.xml and metadata.json, resulting in the
# total build to take 60 seconds longer to build (!).
#
# The list below is used for *production* deploys, and overrides the one defined
# in "_config.yml", which is used for local builds and pull-request previews.

This page contains information on how to write technical content that involves a user interface (UI).

## Format names of UI elements

Always bold UI elements when referring to them by name.

This includes names for buttons, menus, dialogs, windows, list items, or any other feature on the page that has a visible name.

Don't make an official feature name or product name bold, except when it directly refers to an element on the page that uses the name, such as a window title or button name.

In most cases, follow the capitalization as it appears on the page. However, if labels are inconsistent or they're all uppercase, use sentence case.

## Focus on the task

When practical, state instructions in terms of what the user should accomplish, rather than focusing on the widgets and gestures. By avoiding reference to UI elements, you help the user understand the purpose of an instruction, and it can help future-proof procedures.

|Correct     |Incorrect    |
|:-----------|:------------|
|Expand the **Advanced options** section | Select the zippy to expand the **Advanced options** section|


## Refer to UI elements
Don't use UI elements as if they were English verbs or nouns.

|Correct     |Incorrect    |
|:-----------|:------------|

|To save the settings, select **Save**.| **Save** the settings.|

## Prepositions

When documenting the UI, use the following prepositions.

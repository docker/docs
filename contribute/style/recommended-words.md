To help ensure consistency in the documentation, the Technical Writing team recommends these wording choices.

#### above
Try to avoid using above when referring to an example or table in a documentation page. If required, use previous instead. For example:

In the previous example, the dog had fleas.

#### below
Try to avoid below when referring to an example or table in a documentation page. If required, use following instead.

#### checkbox

Use one word for checkbox. Do not use check box.
You select (not check or enable) and clear (not deselect or disable) checkboxes.

#### click

Do not use click. Instead, use select with buttons, links, menu items, and lists. 
Select applies to more devices, while click is more specific to a mouse.

#### currently 

Do not use currently when talking about the product or its features. The documentation describes the product as it is today.

#### delete

We use delete in the UI 

#### deselect 

Don’t use deselect. Instead, use clear. 

#### earlier

Use earlier when talking about version numbers.

Use:

In GitLab 14.1 and earlier.
Instead of:

In GitLab 14.1 and lower.

#### later
Use later when talking about version numbers.

Use:

In GitLab 14.1 and later…
Instead of:

In GitLab 14.1 and higher…
In GitLab 14.1 and above…

#### prerequisites 

#### register
Use register instead of sign up when talking about creating an account

#### respectively
Avoid respectively and be more precise instead.

Use:

To create a user, select Create user. For an existing user, select Save changes.

#### scroll

Avoid. Use a verb phrase such as move through or navigate to instead, if the context is clear.

#### sign in
Use sign in instead of sign on or log on or log in. If the user interface has different words, use those.


#### sign up
Use register or create account instead of sign up when talking about creating an account.

#### toggle

You turn on or turn off a toggle. For example:

Turn on the blah toggle.

#### update

#### upgrade
Use upgrade for:

Choosing a higher subscription tier

#### we

Try to avoid we and focus instead on how the user can accomplish something in GitLab.

Use:

Use widgets when you have work you want to organize.
Instead of:

We created a feature for you to add widgets.
One exception: You can use we recommend instead of it is recommended or GitLab recommends.

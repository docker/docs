To help ensure consistency across our documentation, the Technical Writing team recommends these wording choices.

#### above
Try to avoid using `above` when referring to an example or table in a documentation page. If required, use `previous` instead. 

For example:

_In the previous example, the dog had fleas._

#### below
Try to avoid `below` when referring to an example or table in a documentation page. If required, use `following` instead.

For example:

_In the following example, the dog had fleas._

#### checkbox

Use one word for `checkbox`. Do not use `check box`.

You select (not check or enable) and clear (not deselect or disable) checkboxes.

#### click

Do not use `click`. Instead, use `select` with buttons, links, menu items, and lists. 

Select applies to more devices, while click is more specific to a mouse.

#### currently 

Do not use `currently` when talking about the product or its features. The documentation describes the product as it is today.

#### deselect 

Don’t use `deselect`. Instead, use `clear`. 

#### earlier

Use `earlier` when talking about version numbers.

Use:

_In Docker Desktop 4.1 and earlier._

Instead of:

_In Docker Desktop 4.1 and lower._

#### later
Use `later` when talking about version numbers.

Use:

_In GitLab 14.1 and later._

Instead of:

_In GitLab 14.1 and higher…_ or _In GitLab 14.1 and above…_

#### register
Use `register` instead of sign up when talking about creating an account.

#### respectively
Avoid `respectively` and be more precise instead.

#### scroll

Avoid. Use a verb phrase such as _move through_ or _navigate to_ instead, if the context is clear.

#### sign in
Use `sign in` instead of `sign on` or `log on` or `log in`. If the user interface has different words, use those.


#### sign up
Use `register` or `create account` instead of `sign up` when talking about creating an account.

#### toggle

You turn on or turn off a toggle. For example:

_Turn on the dark mode toggle._

#### upgrade
Use `upgrade` for when describing a higher subscription tier

#### we

Try to avoid `we` and focus instead on how the user can accomplish something in Docker.

Use:

_Use widgets when you have work you want to organize._

Instead of:

_We created a feature for you to add widgets.
One exception: You can use we recommend instead of it is recommended or GitLab recommends._

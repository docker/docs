## Example

- A small image: ![a small cute image](/assets/images/footer_moby_icon.png)

- A small image that is a link. The extra newline here makes it not show inline:

  [![a small cute image](/assets/images/footer_moby_icon.png)](https://www.docker.com/)

- Set the size of an image: ![a pretty wide image](/assets/images/banner_image_24512.png){:width="750px"}

- A big wide image: ![a pretty wide image](/assets/images/banner_image_24512.png)

- The same as above but using HTML: <img src="/assets/images/banner_image_24512.png" alt="a wide image using HTML"/>

Use this checklist to communicate in a way that is clear, helpful, and consistent with the rest of Docker Docs.

##### Used active voice

Active voice is specific and removes ambiguity. If you can add ‘by zombies’ after the verb, you’ll know you’re using passive voice.

##### Written clear sentences that get to the point

Write short, concise sentences. Punchy sentences are faster to read and easier to understand.

##### Used subheadings and bulleted lists to break up the page

This helps ‘scanners’ find the information they need quickly and easily.

##### Started the title of your page with a verb

For example, _Install Docker Desktop_.

##### Checked that the left-hand table of content title in docs.docker.com, matches the title displayed on the page

##### Checked for broken links and images

Use relative links to link to other pages or images within the docker.github.io repo.

##### Checked that any redirects you may have added, work

For information on how to add redirects, see [Source file conventions](file-conventions.md)

##### Used bold on any UI elements you refer to in your content

##### Completed a final spelling, punctuation, and grammar check

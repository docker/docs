This document describes the latest changes, additions, known issues, and fixes
for the commercially supported Docker Engine (CS Engine).

The CS Engine is functionally equivalent to the corresponding Docker Engine that
it references. However, a commercially supported release also includes
back-ported fixes (security-related and priority defects) from the open source.
It incorporates defect fixes that you can use in environments where new features
cannot be adopted as quickly for consistency and compatibility reasons.

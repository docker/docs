DTR requires that a majority (n/2 + 1) of its replicas are healthy at all times
for it to work. So if a majority of replicas is unhealthy or lost, the only
way to restore DTR to a working state, is by recovering from a backup. This
is why it's important to ensure replicas are healthy and perform frequent
backups.

## Data managed by DTR

Docker Trusted Registry maintains data about:

To perform a backup of a DTR node, run the `docker/dtr backup` command. This
command backs up the following data:

## Back up DTR data

To create a backup of DTR you need to:

1. Back up image content
2. Back up DTR metadata

You should always create backups from the same DTR replica, to ensure a smoother
restore.

### Back up image content

Since you can configure the storage backend that DTR uses to store images,
the way you back up images depends on the storage backend you're using.

If you've configured DTR to store images on the local filesystem or NFS mount,
you can back up the images by using ssh to log into a node where DTR is running,
and creating a tar archive of the [dtr-registry volume](../architecture.md):

```none
tar -cf /tmp/backup-images.tar dtr-registry-<replica-id>
```

If you're using a different storage backend, follow the best practices
recommended for that system.


### Back up DTR metadata

To create a DTR backup, load your UCP client bundle, and run the following
command, replacing the placeholders for the real values:

```none
read -sp 'ucp password: ' UCP_PASSWORD; \
docker run -i --rm \
  --env UCP_PASSWORD=$UCP_PASSWORD \
  docker/dtr:<version> backup \
  --ucp-url <ucp-url> \
  --ucp-insecure-tls \
  --ucp-username <ucp-username> \
  --existing-replica-id <replica-id> > /tmp/backup-metadata.tar
```

Where:

* `<version>`, the version of DTR you're running.
* `<ucp-url>` is the url you use to access UCP.
* `<ucp-username>` is the username of a UCP administrator.
* `<replica-id>` is the ID of the DTR replica to back up.

You can find the DTR replica IDs by navigating to the **Stacks** page in
the **UCP web UI**.

![replica id](../images/backup-and-disaster-recovery-1.png){: .with-border}

The backup script prompts you for the UCP password, backs up the DTR metadata,
and saves the result into a tar archive. You can learn more about the supported
flags in the [reference documentation](../../reference/cli/backup.md).

The backup command doesn't stop DTR, so that you can take frequent backups
without affecting your users. Also, the backup contains sensitive information
like private keys, so you can encrypt the backup by running:

```none
gpg --symmetric /tmp/backup-metadata.tar
```

This prompts you for a password to encrypt the backup, copies the backup file
and encrypts it.

### Test your backups

To validate that the backup was correctly performed, you can print the contents
of the tar file created. The backup of the images should look like:

```none
tar -tf /tmp/backup-images.tar

dtr-backup-v2.2.3/
dtr-backup-v2.2.3/rethink/
dtr-backup-v2.2.3/rethink/layers/
```

And the backup of the DTR metadata should look like:

```none
dtr-backup-v2.2.1/
dtr-backup-v2.2.1/rethink/
dtr-backup-v2.2.1/rethink/properties/
dtr-backup-v2.2.1/rethink/properties/0
```

If you've encrypted the metadata backup, you can use:

```none
gpg -d /tmp/backup.tar.gpg | tar -t
```

You can also create a backup of a UCP cluster and restore it into a new
cluster. Then restore DTR on that new cluster to confirm that everything is
working as expected.

## Restore DTR data

If your DTR has a majority of unhealthy replicas, the one way to restore it to
a working state is by restoring from an existing backup.

To restore DTR, you need to:

1. Stop any DTR containers that might be running
2. Restore the images from a backup
3. Restore DTR metadata from a backup
4. Re-fetch the vulnerability database

You need to restore DTR on the same UCP cluster where you've created the
backup. If you restore on a different UCP cluster, all DTR resources will be
owned by users that don't exist, so you can't manage the resources,
even though they're stored in the DTR data store.

When restoring, you need to use the same version of the `docker/dtr` image
that you've used when creating the update. Other versions are not guaranteed
to work.

### Stop DTR containers

Start by removing any DTR container that is still running:

```none
docker run -it --rm \
  docker/dtr:<version> destroy \
  --ucp-insecure-tls
```

### Restore images

If you had DTR configured to store images on the local filesystem, you can
extract your backup:

```none
sudo tar -xzf /tmp/image-backup.tar -C /var/lib/docker/volumes
```

If you're using a different storage backend, follow the best practices
recommended for that system. When restoring the DTR metadata, DTR will be
deployed with the same configurations it had when creating the backup.


### Restore DTR metadata

You can restore the DTR metadata with the `docker/dtr restore` command. This
performs a fresh installation of DTR, and reconfigures it with
the configuration created during a backup.

Load your UCP client bundle, and run the following command, replacing the
placeholders for the real values:

```none
read -sp 'ucp password: ' UCP_PASSWORD; \
docker run -i --rm \
  --env UCP_PASSWORD=$UCP_PASSWORD \
  docker/dtr:<version> restore \
  --ucp-url <ucp-url> \
  --ucp-insecure-tls \
  --ucp-username <ucp-username> \
  --ucp-node <hostname> \
  --replica-id <replica-id> \
  --dtr-external-url <dtr-external-url> < /tmp/backup-metadata.tar
```

Where:

* `<version>`, the version of DTR you're running
* `<ucp-url>` is the url you use to access UCP
* `<ucp-username>` is the username of a UCP administrator
* `<hostname>` is the hostname of the node where you've restored the images
* `<replica-id>` the ID of the replica you backed up
* `<dtr-external-url>` the url that clients use to access DTR

### Re-fetch the vulnerability database

If you're scanning images, you now need to download the vulnerability database.

After you successfully restore DTR, you can join new replicas the same way you
would after a fresh installation. [Learn more](configure/set-up-vulnerability-scans.md).

You can configure DTR to store Docker images on Amazon S3, or other file servers
with an S3-compatible API like Minio.

Amazon S3 and compatible services store files in "buckets", and users have
permissions to read, write, and delete files from those buckets. When you
integrate DTR with Amazon S3, DTR sends all read and write operations to the
S3 bucket so that the images are persisted there.

## Create a bucket on Amazon S3

Before configuring DTR you need to create a bucket on Amazon S3.
To get faster pulls and pushes, you should create the S3 bucket on a region
that's physically close to the servers where DTR is running.

Start by
[creating a bucket](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html).
Then, as a best practice you should
[create a new IAM user](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html)
just for the DTR
integration and apply a IAM policy that ensures the user has limited permissions.

This user only needs permissions to access the bucket that you use to store
images, and to read, write, and delete files.

Here's an example of a policy like that:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*"
        }
    ]
}

```



## Configure DTR

Once you've created a bucket and user, you can configure DTR to use it.
Navigate to the **DTR web UI**, go to **Settings**, and choose **Storage**.

Select the **S3** option, and fill-in the information about the bucket and
user.

Install and restore DTR from an existing backup

## Usage

```bash
docker run -i --rm docker/dtr \
    restore [command options] < backup.tar
```

## Description


This command performs a fresh installation of DTR, and reconfigures it
with configuration data from a tar file generated by the 'backup' command.

This command does not restore Docker images. You should implement a separate
restore procedure for the Docker images stored in your registry, taking in
consideration whether your DTR installation is configured to store images on
the local filesystem or using a cloud provider.

After restoring, you can add more DTR replicas by using the the 'join' command.


## Options

| Option                        | Environment Variable      | Description                                                                          |
|:------------------------------|:--------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--debug` | $DEBUG | Enable debug mode for additional logs. |
| `--dtr-ca` | $DTR_CA | Use a PEM-encoded TLS CA certificate for DTR.By default DTR generates a self-signed TLS certificate during deployment. You can use your  own TLS CA certificate with --dtr-ca "$(cat ca.pem)". |
| `--dtr-cert` | $DTR_CERT | Use a PEM-encoded TLS certificate for DTR.By default DTR generates a self-signed TLS certificate during deployment. You can use your  own TLS certificate with --dtr-cert "$(cat ca.pem)". |
| `--dtr-external-url` | $DTR_EXTERNAL_URL | URL of the host or load balancer clients use to reach DTR.When you use this flag, users are redirected to UCP for logging in. Once authenticated  they are redirected to the url you specify in this flag. If you don't use this flag, DTR  is deployed without single sign-on with UCP. Users and teams are shared but users login  separately into the two applications. You can enable and disable single sign-on in the DTR  settings. Format https://host[:port], where port is the value you used  with --replica-https-port. |
| `--dtr-key` | $DTR_KEY | Use a PEM-encoded TLS private key for DTR.By default DTR generates a self-signed TLS certificate during deployment. You can use your  own TLS private key with --dtr-key "$(cat ca.pem)". |
| `--dtr-storage-volume` | $DTR_STORAGE_VOLUME | Customize the volume to store Docker images.By default DTR creates a volume to store the Docker images in the local  filesystem of the node where DTR is running, without high-availability. Use this flag to  specify a full path or volume name for DTR to store images. For high-availability, make  sure all DTR replicas can read and write data on this volume. If you're using NFS, use  --nfs-storage-url instead. |
| `--enable-pprof` | $DTR_PPROF | Enables pprof profiling of the server.Once DTR is deployed with this flag, you can access the pprof endpoint for the api server  at /debug/pprof, and the registry endpoint at /registry_debug_pprof/debug/pprof. |
| `--help-extended` | $DTR_EXTENDED_HELP | Display extended help text for a given command. |
| `--http-proxy` | $DTR_HTTP_PROXY | The HTTP proxy used for outgoing requests. |
| `--https-proxy` | $DTR_HTTPS_PROXY | The HTTPS proxy used for outgoing requests. |
| `--log-host` | $LOG_HOST | Where to send logs to.The endpoint to send logs to. Use this flag if you set --log-protocol to tcp or udp. |
| `--log-level` | $LOG_LEVEL | Log level for all container logs when logging to syslog. Default: INFO. |
| `--log-protocol` | $LOG_PROTOCOL | The protocol for sending logs. Default is internal.This allows to define the protocol used to send container logs to an external system. The  supported protocals are tcp, udp, or internal. Use this flag with --log-host. |
| `--nfs-storage-url` | $NFS_STORAGE_URL | NFS to store Docker images. Format nfs://<ip&#124;hostname>/<mountpoint>.By default DTR creates a volume to store the Docker images in the local filesystem  of the node where DTR is running, without high-availability. Use this flag to specify an  NFS mount for DTR to store images, using the format nfs://<ip&#124;hostname>/<mountpoint>. To  use this flag, you need to install an NFS client library like nfs-common in the node  where you're deploying DTR. You can test this by running showmount -e <nfs-server>. When  you join new replicas, they will start using NFS so you don't need to use this flag. To  reconfigure DTR to stop using NFS, leave this option empty. |
| `--no-proxy` | $DTR_NO_PROXY | List of domains the proxy should not be used for.When using --http-proxy you can use this flag to specify a list  of domains that you don't want to route throught the proxy. Format acme.com[, acme.org]. |
| `--replica-http-port` | $REPLICA_HTTP_PORT | The public HTTP port for the DTR replica. Default is 80.This allows you to customize the HTTP port where users can reach DTR. Once users access  the HTTP port, they are redirected to use an HTTPS connection, using the port specified  with --replica-https-port. This port can also be used for unencrypted health checks. |
| `--replica-https-port` | $REPLICA_HTTPS_PORT | The public HTTPS port for the DTR replica. Default is 443.This allows you to customize the HTTPS port where users can reach DTR. Each replica can  use a different port. |
| `--replica-id` | $DTR_INSTALL_REPLICA_ID | Assign an ID to the DTR replica. Random by default. |
| `--ucp-ca` | $UCP_CA | Use a PEM-encoded TLS CA certificate for UCP.Download the UCP TLS CA certificate from https://<ucp-url>/ca, and  use --ucp-ca "$(cat ca.pem)". |
| `--ucp-insecure-tls` | $UCP_INSECURE_TLS | Disable TLS verification for UCP.The installation uses TLS but always trusts  the TLS certificate used by UCP, which can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.  For production deployments, use --ucp-ca "$(cat ca.pem)" instead. |
| `--ucp-node` | $UCP_NODE | The hostname of the UCP node to deploy DTR. Random by default.You can find the hostnames of the nodes in the cluster in the UCP web UI, or  by running 'docker node ls' on a UCP manager node.. |
| `--ucp-password` | $UCP_PASSWORD | The UCP administrator password. |
| `--ucp-url` | $UCP_URL | The UCP URL including domain and port. |
| `--ucp-username` | $UCP_USERNAME | The UCP administrator username. |

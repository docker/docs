The procedure to install Docker Trusted Registry on a host is the same,
whether that host has access to the internet or not.

The only difference when installing on an offline host,
is that instead of pulling the UCP images from Docker Hub, you use a
computer that is connected to the internet to download a single package with
all the images. Then you copy that package to the host where youâ€™ll install DTR.

## Versions available

{% include components/ddc_url_list_2.html product="dtr" version="2.3" %}

## Download the offline package

Use a computer with internet access to download a package with all DTR images:

```bash
$ wget <package-url> -O dtr.tar.gz
```

Now that you have the package in your local machine, you can transfer it to
the machines where you want to install DTR.

For each machine where you want to install DTR:

1.  Copy the DTR package to that machine.

    ```bash
    $ scp dtr.tar.gz <user>@<host>
    ```

2.  Use ssh to log into the hosts where you transferred the package.

3.  Load the DTR images.

    Once the package is transferred to the hosts, you can use the
    `docker load` command to load the Docker images from the tar archive:

    ```bash
    $ docker load < dtr.tar.gz
    ```

## Install DTR

Now that the offline hosts have all the images needed to install DTR,
you can [install DTR on that host](index.md).

### Preventing outgoing connections

DTR makes outgoing connections to:

* report analytics,
* check for new versions,
* check online licenses,
* update the vulnerability scanning database

All of these uses of online connections are optional. You can choose to
disable or not use any or all of these features on the admin settings page.

Uninstalling DTR can be done by simply removing all data associated with each
replica. To do that, you just run the destroy command once per replica:

```none
docker run -it --rm \
  docker/dtr:{{ page.dtr_version }} destroy \
  --ucp-insecure-tls
```

You will be prompted for the UCP URL, UCP credentials, and which replica to
destroy.

To see what options are available in the destroy command, check the
[destroy command reference documentation](../../../reference/cli/destroy.md).

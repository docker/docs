Your Docker Enterprise Edition subscription gives you access to prioritized
support. The service levels depend on your subscription.

Before reaching out to Docker Support, make sure you're listed as an authorized
support contact for your account. If you're not listed as an authorized
support contact, find a person who is, and ask them to open a case with
Docker Support in your behalf.

You can open a new support case at the [Docker support page](https://support.docker.com/).
If you're unable to submit a new case using the support page, fill in the
[Docker account support form](https://success.docker.com/support) using your
company email address.

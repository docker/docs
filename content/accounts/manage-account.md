You can manage the settings for your Docker account in Docker Dashboard. Here you can also take administrative actions for your account and manage your account security.

> If your account is associated with an organization that enforces Single Sign-On (SSO), you may not have permissions to update your account settings. You need to contact your administrator to update your settings.

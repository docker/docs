## 25.0.0

{{< release-date date="2024-01-19" >}}

For a full list of pull requests and changes in this release, refer to the relevant GitHub milestones:

- [docker/cli, 25.0.0 milestone](https://github.com/docker/cli/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A25.0.0)

> **Note**
>
> In earlier versions of Docker Engine, recursive mounts (submounts) would
> always be mounted as writable, even when specifying a read-only mount. This
> behavior has changed in v25.0.0, for hosts running on kernel version 5.12 or
> later. Now, read-only bind mounts are **recursively read-only** by default.
>
> To get the same behavior as earlier releases, you can specify the
> `bind-recursive` option for the `--mount` flag.
>
> ```console
> $ docker run --mount type=bind,src=SRC,dst=DST,readonly,bind-recursive=writable IMAGE
> ```
>
> This option isn't supported with the `-v` or `--volume` flag.
> For more information, see
> [Recursive mounts](../../storage/bind-mounts.md#recursive-mounts).

### New

- The daemon now uses systemd's default `LimitNOFILE`. In earlier versions of
  Docker Engine, this limit was set to `infinity`. This would cause issues with
  recent versions of systemd, where the hard limit was increased, causing
  programs that adjusted their behaviors based on ulimits to consume a high
  amount of memory. [moby/moby#45534](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/45534)

  The new setting makes containers behave the same way as programs running on
  the host, but may cause programs that make incorrect assumptions based on the
  soft limit to misbehave. To get the previous behavior, you can set
  `LimitNOFILE=1048576`.

  This change currently only affects build containers created with `docker
  build` when using BuildKit with the `docker` driver. Future versions of
  containerd will also use this limit, which will cause this behavior to affect
  all containers, not only build containers.

  If you're experiencing issues with the higher ulimit in systemd v240 or later,
  consider adding a system `drop-in` or `override` file to configure the ulimit
  settings for your setup. The [Flatcar Container Linux documentation](https://www.flatcar.org/docs/latest/setup/systemd/drop-in-units/)
  has a great article covering this topic in detail.

### Known limitations

#### Extended attributes for tar files

In this release, the code that handles `tar` archives was changed to be more
strict and to produce an error when failing to write extended attributes
(`xattr`). The `tar` implementation for macOS generates additional extended
attributes by default when creating tar files. These attribute prefixes aren't
valid Linux `xattr` namespace prefixes, which causes an error when Docker
attempts to process these files. For example, if you try to use a tar file with
an `ADD` Dockerfile instruction, you might see an error message similar to the
following:

```text
failed to solve: lsetxattr /sftp_key.ppk: operation not supported
```

Error messages related to extended attribute validation were improved to
include more context in [v25.0.1](#2501), but the limitation in Docker being
unable to process the files remains. Tar files created with the macOS `tar`
using default arguments will produce an error when the tar file is used with
Docker.

As a workaround, if you need to use tar files with Docker generated on macOS,
you can either:

- Use the `--no-xattr` flag for the macOS `tar` command to strip **all** the
  extended attributes. If you want to preserve extended attributes, this isn't
  a recommended option.
- Install and use `gnu-tar` to create the tarballs on macOS instead of the
  default `tar` implementation. To install `gnu-tar` using Homebrew:

  ```console
  $ brew install gnu-tar
  ```

  After installing, add the `gnu-tar` binary to your `PATH`, for example by
  updating your `.zshrc` file:

  ```console
  $ echo 'PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/gnu-tar/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
  $ source ~/.zshrc
  ```

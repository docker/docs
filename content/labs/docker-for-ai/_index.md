Master AI application development with Docker through interactive, hands-on
labspaces. Each lab provides a self-contained environment where you learn by
building real applications using Docker Model Runner, MCP Gateway, cagent, and
more.

## Who's this for?

- Developers building AI-powered applications who want to leverage Docker's AI
  toolchain
- Teams adopting agentic architectures with multi-LLM and multi-tool patterns
- Engineers exploring Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool integration
- Anyone wanting to fine-tune, package, and share custom AI models using Docker

## What you'll learn

- Building agentic apps with Docker Model Runner, MCP Gateway, and Compose
- Running and configuring MCP servers securely with the Docker MCP Gateway
- Fine-tuning models with Docker Offload and sharing them via Docker Hub
- Creating intelligent agent teams with cagent and MCP Toolkit

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (latest version) with Docker Model Runner enabled
- Basic familiarity with Docker and Docker Compose
- A code editor of your choice

## How Labspaces work

Each labspace is a fully containerized learning environment. Launch it with a
single `docker compose` command and open your browser to follow the interactive
guide. The labspace includes all the code, tools, and AI models you need — no
additional setup required.

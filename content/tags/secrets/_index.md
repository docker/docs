description: Use sensitive information in containers securely

A secret is a piece of data, such as a password, SSH private key, SSL
certificate, or anything that should not be transmitted over a network or
stored unencrypted in a Dockerfile or in your application's source code.

Docker provides specially designated features for managing secrets.

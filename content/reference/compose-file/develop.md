{{% include "compose/develop.md" %}}

This page defines how Compose behaves to efficiently assist you and defines the development constraints and workflows set by Compose. Only a subset of Compose file services may require a `develop` subsection.

## Illustrative example

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    image: example/webapp
    build: ./webapp
    develop:
      watch: 
        # sync static content
        - path: ./webapp/html
          action: sync
          target: /var/www
          ignore:
            - node_modules/

  backend:
    image: example/backend
    build: ./backend
    develop:
      watch: 
        # rebuild image and recreate service
        - path: ./backend/src
          action: rebuild
```

## Attributes

<!-- vale Docker.HeadingSentenceCase = NO ) -->

The `develop` subsection defines configuration options that are applied by Compose to assist you during development of a service with optimized workflows.

### `watch`

The `watch` attribute defines a list of rules that control automatic service updates based on local file changes. `watch` is a sequence, each individual item in the sequence defines a rule to be applied by 
Compose to monitor source code for changes. For more information, see [Use Compose Watch](/manuals/compose/how-tos/file-watch.md).

#### `action`

`action` defines the action to take when changes are detected. If `action` is set to:

- `rebuild`: Compose rebuilds the service image based on the `build` section and recreates the service with the updated image.
- `restart`: Compose restarts the service container. Available with Docker Compose version 2.32.0 and later.
- `sync`: Compose keeps the existing service container(s) running, but synchronizes source files with container content according to the `target` attribute.
- `sync+restart`: Compose synchronizes source files with container content according to the `target` attribute, and then restarts the container. Available with Docker Compose version 2.23.0 and later.
- `sync+exec`: Compose synchronizes source files with container content according to the `target` attribute, and then executes a command inside the container. Available with Docker Compose version 2.32.0 and later.

#### `exec`

{{< summary-bar feature_name="Compose exec" >}}

`exec` is only relevant when `action` is set to `sync+exec`. Like [service hooks](services.md#post_start), `exec` is used to define the command to be run inside the container once it has started.

- `command`: Specifies the command to run once the container starts. This attribute is required, and you can choose to use either the shell form or the exec form.
- `user`: The user to run the command. If not set, the command is run with the same user as the main service command.
- `privileged`: Lets the command run with privileged access.
- `working_dir`: The working directory in which to run the command. If not set, it is run in the same working directory as the main service command.
- `environment`: Sets the environment variables to run the command. While the command inherits the environment variables defined for the serviceâ€™s main command, this section lets you add new variables or override existing ones.

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    image: ...
    develop:
      watch: 
        # sync content then run command to reload service without interruption
        - path: ./etc/config
          action: sync+exec
          target: /etc/config/
          exec:
            command: app reload
```

#### `ignore`

The `ignore` attribute can be used to define a list of patterns for paths to be ignored. Any updated file
that matches a pattern, or belongs to a folder that matches a pattern, won't trigger services to be re-created. 
The syntax is the same as `.dockerignore` file: 

- `*` matches 0 or more characters in a filename. 
- `?` matches a single character in filename. 
- `*/*` matches two nested folders with arbitrary names
- `**` matches an arbitrary number of nested folders

If the build context includes a `.dockerignore` file, the patterns in this file is loaded as implicit content
for the `ignores` file, and values set in the Compose model are appended.

#### `path`

`path` attribute defines the path to source code (relative to the project directory) to monitor for changes. Updates to any file
inside the path, which doesn't match any `ignore` rule, triggers the configured action.

#### `target`

`target` attribute only applies when `action` is configured for `sync`. Files within `path` that have changes are synchronized with the container's filesystem, so that the latter is always running with up-to-date content.

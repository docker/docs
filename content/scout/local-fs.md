You can use the `fs://` protocol prefix with Docker Scout CLI commands to
analyze your local source code directly, without having to build and push
container images. The following commands support the `fs://` prefix:

- `docker scout quickview`
- `docker scout cves`
- `docker scout compare`

This feature is available in Docker Scout CLI plugin version 1.0.3 and later.

## Summary

To get an at-a-glance vulnerability summary of the source code in the current
working directory:

```console
$ docker scout quickview fs://.
```

## Details

To view the details of vulnerabilities found in your local source code, you can
use the `docker scout cves --details fs://.` command. Combine it with
other flags to narrow down the results to the packages and vulnerabilities that
you're interested in.

```console
$ docker scout cves --details --only-severity high fs://.

    ✗ HIGH CVE-2022-39288 [OWASP Top Ten 2017 Category A9 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities]
      https://scout.docker.com/v/CVE-2022-39288
    
      fastify is a fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js. Affected versions of 
      fastify are subject to a denial of service via malicious use of the Content-Type    
      header. An attacker can send an invalid Content-Type header that can cause the      
      application to crash. This issue has been addressed in commit  fbb07e8d  and will be
      included in release version 4.8.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to    
      upgrade may manually filter out http content with malicious Content-Type headers.   
    
      Affected range : <4.8.1

## Compare

With `docker scout compare`, you can compare the analysis of source code on
your local filesystem with the analysis of a container image. The following
example compares local source code for the Docker Scout CLI plugin with the
`docker/scout-cli:latest` image on Docker Hub.

```console
$ docker scout compare fs://. --to docker/scout-cli:latest --ignore-unchanged
WARN 'docker scout compare' is experimental and its behaviour might change in the future

The previous example is truncated. The full output also includes a full package
delta for the comparison. The delta shows what packages were added, removed,
and changed between the versions.

The compare output includes VCS provenance for both the local source code and
the compare target, when available.

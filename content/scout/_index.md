Container images are often built from layers of other container images and
software packages. These layers and packages can contain vulnerabilities that
make your containers and the applications they run vulnerable to attack.

Docker Scout can proactively help you find and fix these vulnerabilities,
helping you create a more secure software supply chain. It does this by analyzing your images and creating a full inventory of the
packages and layers called a [Software bill of materials (SBOM)](https://ntia.gov/sites/default/files/publications/sbom_at_a_glance_apr2021_0.pdf).
It then correlates this inventory with a continuously updated vulnerability
database to identify vulnerabilities in your images.

You can use Docker Scout in Docker Desktop, Docker Hub, the Docker CLI, and in
the [Docker Scout Dashboard](./dashboard.md). Docker Scout also supports
integrations with third-party systems, refer to [Integrating Docker
Scout](./integrations/_index.md) for more information.

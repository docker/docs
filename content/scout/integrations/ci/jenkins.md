title: Integrate Docker Scout with Jenkins
---

You can add the following stage and steps definition to a `Jenkinsfile` to run
Docker Scout as part of a Jenkins pipeline. The pipeline needs a `DOCKER_HUB`
credential containing the username and password for authenticating to Docker
Hub. It also needs an environment variable defined for the image and tag.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent {
        // Agent details
    }

    environment {
        DOCKER_HUB = credentials('jenkins-docker-hub-credentials')
        IMAGE_TAG  = 'myorg/scout-demo-service:latest'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Analyze image') {
            steps {
                // Install Docker Scout
                sh 'curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/scout-cli/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin'

                // Log into Docker Hub
                sh 'echo $DOCKER_HUB_PSW | docker login -u $DOCKER_HUB_USR --password-stdin'

                // Analyze and fail on critical or high vulnerabilities
                sh 'docker-scout cves $IMAGE_TAG --exit-code --only-severity critical,high'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This installs Docker Scout, logs into Docker Hub, and then runs Docker Scout to
generate a CVE report for an image and tag. It only shows critical or
high-severity vulnerabilities.

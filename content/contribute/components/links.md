## Examples

[External links](https://docker.com) and [internal links](links.md) both
open in the same tab.

Use relative links, using source filenames.

#### Links to auto-generated content

When you link to heading IDs in auto-generated pages, such as CLI
reference content, you won't get any help from your editor in resolving the
anchor names. That's because the pages are generated at build-time and your
editor or LSP doesn't know about them in advance.

## Syntax

```md
[External links](https://docker.com)
[Internal links](links.md)
```

Domain management lets you add and verify domains, and enable
auto-provisioning for users. Auto-provisioning adds users to your
organization when they sign in with an email address that matches a verified
domain.

This simplifies user management, ensures consistent security settings, and
reduces the risk of unmanaged users accessing Docker without visibility
or control.

## Add a domain

1. Sign in to the [Admin Console](https://admin.docker.com/).
2. Select your organization or company from the **Choose profile** page.
If your organization is part of a company, select the company
and configure the domain for the organization at the company level.
3. Under **Security and access**, select **Domain management**.
4. Select **Add a domain**.
5. Enter your domain and select **Add domain**.
6. In the pop-up modal, copy the **TXT Record Value** to verify your domain.

## Verify a domain

Verifying your domain confirms that you own it. To verify, add a TXT record to
your Domain Name System (DNS) host using the value provided by Docker. This
value proves ownership and instructs your DNS to publish the record.

It can take up to 72 hours for the DNS change to propagate. Docker automatically
checks for the record and confirms ownership once the change is recognized.

Follow your DNS providerâ€™s documentation to add the **TXT Record Value**. If
your provider isn't listed, use the steps for other providers.

> [!TIP]
>
> The record name field determines where the TXT record is added in your domain
(root or subdomain). In general, refer to the following tips for
adding a record name:
>
> - Use `@` or leave the record name empty for root domains like `example.com`,
depending on your provider.
> - Don't enter values like `docker`, `docker-verification`, `www`, or your
domain name. These values may direct to the wrong place.
>
> Check your DNS provider's documentation to verify record name requirements.

1. To add your TXT record to AWS, see [Creating records by using the Amazon Route 53 console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-creating.html).
2. TXT record verification can take 72 hours. Once you have waited for
TXT record verification, return to the **Domain management** page of the
[Admin Console](https://app.docker.com/admin) and select **Verify** next to
your domain name.

record verification, return to the **Domain management** page of the

## Delete a domain

Deleting a domain removes the assigned TXT record value. To delete a domain:

1. Sign in to the [Admin Console](https://admin.docker.com/).
2. Select your organization or company from the **Choose profile** page.
If your organization is part of a company, select the company
and configure the domain for the organization at the company level.
3. Under **Security and access**, select **Domain management**.
4. For the domain you want to delete, section the **Actions** menu, then
**Delete domain**.
5. To confirm, select **Delete domain** in the pop-up modal.

## Auto-provisioning

You must add and verify a domain before enabling auto-provisioning. This
confirms your organization owns the domain. Once a domain is verified,
Docker can automatically associate matching users with your organization.
Auto-provisioning does not require an SSO connection.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> For domains that are part of an SSO connection, Just-in-Time (JIT) overrides
auto-provisioning to add users to an organization.

### How it works

When auto-provisioning is enabled for a verified domain, the next time a user
signs into Docker with an email address that is associated with your verified
domain, they are automatically added to your organization. Auto-provisioning
does not create accounts for new users, it adds existing unassociated users to
your organization. Users will *not* experience any sign in or user experience
changes.

When a new user is auto-provisioned, company and organization owners will
receive an email notifying them that a new user has been added to their
organization. If you need to add more seats to your organization to
to accomodate new users, see [Manage seats](/manuals/subscription/manage-seats.md).

### Enable auto-provisioning

Auto-provisioning is enabled per user. To enable
auto-provisioning:

1. Open the [Admin Console](https://app.docker.com/admin).
2. Select **Domain management** from the left-hand navigation.
3. Select the **Actions menu** next to the user you want to enable
auto-provisioning for.
4. Select **Enable auto-provisioning**.
5. Optional. If enabling auto-provisioning at the company level, select an
organization for the user.
6. Select **Enable** to confirm.

The **Auto-provisioning** column will update to **Enabled**.

### Disable auto-provisioning

To disable auto-provisioning for a user:

1. Open the [Admin Console](https://app.docker.com/admin).
2. Select **Domain management** from the left-hand navigation.
3. Select the **Actions menu** next to your user.
4. Select **Disable auto-provisioning**.
5. Select **Disable**.

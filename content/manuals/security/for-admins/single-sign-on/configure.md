Get started creating a single sign-on (SSO) connection for your organization or company. This guide walks through the steps to add and verify the domains your members use to sign in to Docker.

## Step one: Add your domain

> [!NOTE]
>
> Docker supports multiple identity provider (IdP) configurations. With a multiple IdP configuration, one domain can be associated with more than one SSO identity provider.

{{< tab name="Admin Console" >}}

1. Sign in to the [Admin Console](https://admin.docker.com/).
2. Select your organization or company from the **Choose profile** page. Note that when an organization is part of a company, you must select the company and configure the domain for the organization at the company level.
3. Under **Security and access**, select **Domain management**.
4. Select **Add a domain**.
5. Enter your domain in the text box and select **Add domain**.
6. The pop-up modal will prompt you with steps to verify your domain. Copy the **TXT Record Value**.

1. Sign in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).
2. Select **My Hub** and then your organization from the list.
3. On your organization page, select **Settings** and then **Security**.
4. Select **Add a domain**.
5. Enter your domain in the text box and select **Add domain**.
6. The pop-up modal will prompt you with steps to verify your domain. Copy the **TXT Record Value**.

## Step two: Verify your domain

Verifying your domain ensures Docker knows you own it. To verify, you add a TXT record to your Domain Name System (DNS) host using the value Docker provides. The TXT Record Value proves ownership, which signals the DNS to add this record. It can take up to 72 hours for DNS to recognize the change. When the change is reflected in DNS, Docker automatically checks the record to confirm your ownership.

Use the **TXT Record Value** provided by Docker and follow the steps based on your DNS host. If your provider isn't listed, use the instructions for other providers.

> [!TIP]
>
> The record name field controls where the TXT record is applied in your domain, for example root or subdomain. In general, refer to the following tips for adding a record name:
>
> - Use `@` or leave the record name empty for root domains like `example.com`, depending on your provider.
> - Don't enter values like `docker`, `docker-verification`, `www`, or your domain name. These values may direct to the wrong place.
>
> Check your DNS provider's documentation to verify record name requirements.

1. To add your TXT record to AWS, see [Creating records by using the Amazon Route 53 console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-creating.html).
2. TXT record verification can take 72 hours. Once you have waited for TXT record verification, return to the **Domain management** page of the [Admin Console](https://app.docker.com/admin) and select **Verify** next to your domain name.

Once you have added and verified your domain, you are ready to create an SSO connection between Docker and your identity provider (IdP).

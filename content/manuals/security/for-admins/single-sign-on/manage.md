## Manage users

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> SSO has Just-In-Time (JIT) Provisioning enabled by default unless you have [disabled it](/security/for-admins/provisioning/just-in-time/#sso-authentication-with-jit-provisioning-disabled). This means your users are auto-provisioned to your organization.
>
> You can change this on a per-app basis. To prevent auto-provisioning users, you can create a security group in your IdP and configure the SSO app to authenticate and authorize only those users that are in the security group. Follow the instructions provided by your IdP:

### Add guest users when SSO is enabled

To add a guest that isn't verified through your IdP:

1. Sign in to the [Admin Console](https://app.docker.com/admin).
2. Select **Organizations**, your organization, and then **Members**.
3. Select **Invite**.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to invite the user.

### Remove users from the SSO company

To remove a user:

1. Sign in to [Admin Console](https://app.docker.com/admin).
2. Select **Organizations**, your organization, and then **Members**.
3. Select the action icon next to a userâ€™s name, and then select **Remove member**, if you're an organization, or **Remove user**, if you're a company.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to remove the user.

## Manage provisioning

Users are provisioned with Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning by default. If you enable SCIM, you can disable JIT. For more information, see the [Provisioning overview](/manuals/security/for-admins/provisioning/_index.md) guide.

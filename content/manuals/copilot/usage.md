The Docker Extension for GitHub Copilot provides a chat interface that you can
use to interact with the Docker agent. You can ask questions and get help
Dockerizing your project.

The Docker agent is trained to understand Docker-related questions, and provide
guidance on Dockerfiles, Docker Compose files, and other Docker assets.

## Setup

Before you can start interacting with the Docker agent, make sure you've
[installed](./install.md) the extension for your organization.

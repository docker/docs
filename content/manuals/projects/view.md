View logs for a project
Open a new or existing project.
Select the Logs tab to see all project logs.
Optionally, use the menu in the top right corner of the logs to copy the logs to your clipboard or clear the logs.

## View service-level information 

With Docker Projects, you can view the following information about your containers within your project:

 - Logs
 - Files
 - Network
 - Environment variables

From the Exec tab, you can use the integrated terminal, on a running container, directly within Docker Desktop. You are able to quickly run commands within your container so you can understand its current state or debug when something goes wrong.

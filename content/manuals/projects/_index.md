{{< summary-bar feature_name="Docker Projects" >}}

Docker Projects provides a simplified, project-based workflow for running and managing containerized applications. It organizes your code, configurations, and logs across local and cloud environments into a single view, making it easy to collaborate and share across teams.

A project organizes your code and Docker artifacts into a single object. These artifacts include logs as well as customizable run commands. These artifacts can persist remotely in the cloud, which lets you access your projects from any device that has Docker Desktop.

### Key features and benefits

 - One-click project setup: Open a local folder or clone a Git repository and run your project instantly.
 - Minimal Docker expertise required: Ideal for both beginners and experienced developers.
 - Custom `run` commands for your projects: Define and store pre-configured `run` commands that are equivalent to running `docker compose up`.
 - Local and remote projects: Work on projects locally or sync artifacts to the cloud for cross-device access and easy collaboration.

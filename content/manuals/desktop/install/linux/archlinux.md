## Prerequisites

To install Docker Desktop successfully, you must meet the [general system requirements](_index.md#general-system-requirements).

## Install Docker Desktop

1. [Install the Docker client binary on Linux](/manuals/engine/install/binaries.md#install-daemon-and-client-binaries-on-linux). Static binaries for the Docker client are available for Linux as `docker`. You can use:

   ```console
   $ wget https://download.docker.com/linux/static/stable/x86_64/docker-{{% param "docker_ce_version" %}}.tgz -qO- | tar xvfz - docker/docker --strip-components=1
   $ mv ./docker /usr/local/bin
   ```

2. Download the latest Arch package from the [Release notes](/manuals/desktop/release-notes.md).

3. Install the package:

   ```console
   $ sudo pacman -U ./docker-desktop-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
   ```

   By default, Docker Desktop is installed at `/opt/docker-desktop`.

This page contains information on how to install, launch, and upgrade Docker Desktop on a Debian distribution.

## Prerequisites

To install Docker Desktop successfully, you must:

- Meet the [general system requirements](_index.md#general-system-requirements).
- Have a 64-bit version of Debian 12.
- For a Gnome Desktop environment, you must also install AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem [Gnome extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/).

- For non-Gnome Desktop environments, `gnome-terminal` must be installed:

  ```console
  $ sudo apt install gnome-terminal
  ```

## Install Docker Desktop

Recommended approach to install Docker Desktop on Debian:

1. Set up Docker's `apt` repository.
   See step one of [Install using the `apt` repository](/manuals/engine/install/debian.md#install-using-the-repository).

2. Download the latest [DEB package](https://desktop.docker.com/linux/main/amd64/docker-desktop-amd64.deb?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=docs-driven-download-linux-amd64). For checksums, see the [Release notes](/manuals/desktop/release-notes.md).

3. Install the package with apt as follows:

  ```console
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install ./docker-desktop-amd64.deb
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > At the end of the installation process, `apt` displays an error due to installing a downloaded package. You
  > can ignore this error message.
  >
  > ```text
  > N: Download is performed unsandboxed as root, as file '/home/user/Downloads/docker-desktop.deb' couldn't be accessed by user '_apt'. - pkgAcquire::Run (13: Permission denied)
  > ```

   By default, Docker Desktop is installed at `/opt/docker-desktop`.

There are a few post-install configuration steps done through the post-install script contained in the deb package.

The post-install script:

- Sets the capability on the Docker Desktop binary to map privileged ports and set resource limits.
- Adds a DNS name for Kubernetes to `/etc/hosts`.
- Creates a symlink from `/usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli` to `/usr/bin/docker`.
  This is because the classic Docker CLI is installed at `/usr/bin/docker`. The Docker Desktop installer also installs a Docker CLI binary that includes cloud-integration capabilities and is essentially a wrapper for the Compose CLI, at`/usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli`. The symlink ensures that the wrapper can access the classic Docker CLI. 

## Launch Docker Desktop

{{< include "desktop-linux-launch.md" >}}

## Upgrade Docker Desktop

Once a new version for Docker Desktop is released, the Docker UI shows a notification.
You need to download the new package each time you want to upgrade Docker Desktop and run:

```console
$ sudo apt-get install ./docker-desktop-<arch>.deb
```

Don't forget to substitute `<arch>` with the architecture you want.

Docker Desktop for Windows supports NVIDIA GPU Paravirtualization (GPU-PV) on NVIDIA GPUs, allowing containers to access GPU resources for compute-intensive workloads like AI, machine learning, or video processing.

## Prerequisites

To enable WSL 2 GPU Paravirtualization, you need:

- A Windows machine with an NVIDIA GPU
- Up to date Windows 10 or Windows 11 installation
- [Up to date drivers](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl) from NVIDIA supporting WSL 2 GPU Paravirtualization
- The latest version of the WSL 2 Linux kernel. Use `wsl --update` on the command line
- To make sure the [WSL 2 backend is turned on](wsl/_index.md#turn-on-docker-desktop-wsl-2) in Docker Desktop

## Validate GPU support

To confirm GPU access is working inside Docker, run the following:

```console
$ docker run --rm -it --gpus=all nvcr.io/nvidia/k8s/cuda-sample:nbody nbody -gpu -benchmark
```

This runs an n-body simulation benchmark on the GPU. The output will be similar to:

```console
Run "nbody -benchmark [-numbodies=<numBodies>]" to measure performance.
        -fullscreen       (run n-body simulation in fullscreen mode)
        -fp64             (use double precision floating point values for simulation)
        -hostmem          (stores simulation data in host memory)
        -benchmark        (run benchmark to measure performance)
        -numbodies=<N>    (number of bodies (>= 1) to run in simulation)
        -device=<d>       (where d=0,1,2.... for the CUDA device to use)
        -numdevices=<i>   (where i=(number of CUDA devices > 0) to use for simulation)
        -compare          (compares simulation results running once on the default GPU and once on the CPU)
        -cpu              (run n-body simulation on the CPU)
        -tipsy=<file.bin> (load a tipsy model file for simulation)

## Run a real-world model: Llama2 with Ollama

Use the [official Ollama image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ollama/ollama) to run the Llama2 LLM with GPU acceleration:

```console
$ docker run --gpus=all -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
```

Then start the model:

```console
$ docker exec -it ollama ollama run llama2
```

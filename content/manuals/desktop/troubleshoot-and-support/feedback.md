There are many ways you can provide feedback on Docker Desktop or Docker Desktop features.

### In-product feedback

On each Docker Desktop Dashboard view, there is a **Give feedback** link. This sends you to a Google feedback form where you can share your feedback and ideas.

You can also use the `docker feedback` command to submit feedback directly from the command line.

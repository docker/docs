### How is personal diagnostic data handled in Docker Desktop?
When uploading diagnostics to help Docker with investigating issues, the uploaded diagnostics bundle may contain personal data such as 
usernames and IP addresses. The diagnostics bundles are only accessible to Docker, Inc.
employees who are directly involved in diagnosing Docker Desktop issues.
By default, Docker, Inc. colud delete uploaded diagnostics bundles after 30 days due to storage limits.
You may also request the removal of a diagnostics bundle by either specifying the diagnostics ID or via your GitHub ID (if the 
diagnostics ID is mentioned in a GitHub issue). Docker, Inc. will only use the data in the diagnostics bundle to investigate specific 
user issues but may derive high-level (non personal) metrics such as the rate of issues from it.

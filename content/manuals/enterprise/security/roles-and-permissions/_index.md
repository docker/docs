Roles control what users can do in your Docker organization. When you invite users or create teams, you assign them roles that determine their permissions for repositories, teams, and organization settings.

Docker provides two types of roles to meet different organizational needs:

- [Core roles](/manuals/enterprise/security/roles-and-permissions/core-roles.md) with predefined permissions
- [Custom roles](/manuals/enterprise/security/roles-and-permissions/custom-roles.md) that you can tailor to your specific requirements

## Docker roles

### Core roles

Core roles are Docker's built-in roles with predefined permission sets:

- Member: Non-administrative role with basic access. Members can view other organization members and pull images from repositories they have access to.
- Editor: Partial administrative access. Editors can create, edit, and delete repositories, and manage team permissions for repositories.
- Owner: Full administrative access. Owners can manage all organization settings, including repositories, teams, members, billing, and security features.

### Custom roles

Custom roles allow you to create tailored permission sets by selecting specific permissions from categories like user management, team management, billing, and Hub permissions. Use custom roles when Docker's core roles don't fit your needs.

## When to use each role

Use core roles when:

- Docker's predefined permission sets match your organizational structure
- You want simple, straightforward role assignments
- You're getting started with Docker organization management
- Your access control needs are standard and don't require fine-grained permissions

Use custom roles when:
- You need specific permission combinations not available in core roles
- You want to create specialized roles like billing administrators, security auditors, or repository managers
- You need department-specific access control
- You want to implement the principle of least privilege with precise permission grants

## How roles work together

Users and teams can be assigned either a core role or a custom role, but not both. However, roles work in combination with team permissions:

1. Role permissions: Applied organization-wide (core or custom role)
2. Team permissions: Additional permissions for specific repositories when users are added to teams

This layered approach gives you flexibility to provide broad organizational access through roles and specific repository access through team memberships.

Custom roles allow you to create tailored permission sets that match your
organization's specific needs. This page covers custom roles, and steps
to create and manage them.

## What are custom roles?

Custom roles let you create tailored permission sets for your organization. You
can assign custom roles to individual users or teams.
Users get either a core role or custom role, but not both.

Use custom roles when Docker's default roles don't fit your needs.

## Prerequisites

To configure custom roles, you need owner permissions in your Docker
organization.

## Create a custom role

Before you can assign a custom role to users, you must create one in the
Admin Console:

1. Sign in to [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com).
1. Select **Admin Console**, then **User management**.
1. Select **Roles**, then **Create role**.
1. Create a name and describe what the role is for:
    - Provide a **Display name**
    - Enter a unique **Name** identifier (can't be changed later)
    - Add an optional **Description**
1. Set permissions for the role by expanding permission categories and selecting
the checkboxes for permissions. For a full list of available permissions, see
the [custom roles permissions reference](#custom-roles-permissions-reference).
1. Select **Review** to review your custom roles configruation and see a summary
of selected permissions.

{{< summary-bar feature_name="Compliance reporting" >}}

Desktop settings reporting tracks user compliance with Docker Desktop settings policies. Use this feature to monitor policy application across your organization and identify users who need assistance with compliance.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use Docker Desktop settings reporting, make sure you have:

- [Docker Desktop 4.37.1 or later](/manuals/desktop/release-notes.md) installed across your organization
- [A verified domain](/manuals/enterprise/security/single-sign-on/configure.md#step-one-add-and-verify-your-domain)
- [Enforced sign-in](/manuals/enterprise/security/enforce-sign-in/_index.md) for your organization
- A Docker Business subscription
- At least one settings policy configured

> [!WARNING]
>
> Users on Docker Desktop versions older than 4.40 may appear non-compliant because older versions can't report compliance status. For accurate reporting, update users to Docker Desktop version 4.40 or later.

## Access the reporting dashboard

To view compliance reporting:

1. Sign in to [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com) and select
your organization.
1. Select **Admin Console**, then **Desktop settings reporting**.

The reporting dashboard provides these tools:

- A search field to find users by username or email address
- Filter options to show users assigned to specific policies
- Toggles to hide or un-hide compliant users
- Compliance status indicators
- CSV export option to download compliance data

## User compliance statuses

Docker Desktop evaluates three types of status to determine overall compliance:

### Compliance status

This is the primary status shown in the dashboard:

| Compliance status | What it means |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Compliant | The user fetched and applied the latest assigned policy. |
| Non-compliant | The user fetched the correct policy, but hasn't applied it. |
| Outdated | The user fetched a previous version of the policy. |
| No policy assigned | The user does not have any policy assigned to them. |
| Uncontrolled domain | The user's email domain is not verified. |

### Domain status

Shows how the user's email domain relates to your organization:

| Domain status | What it means |
|---------------|---------------|
| Verified | The userâ€™s email domain is verified. |
| Guest user | The user's email domain is not verified. |
| Domainless | Your organization has no verified domains, and the user's domain is unknown. |

### Settings status

Indicates the user's policy assignment:

| Settings status | What it means |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Global policy | The user is assigned your organization's default policy. |
| User policy | The user is assigned a specific custom policy. |
| No policy assigned | The user is not assigned to any policy. |

## Monitor compliance

From the **Desktop settings reporting** dashboard, you can:

- Review organization-wide compliance at a glance
- Turn on **Hide compliant users** to focus on issues
- Filter by specific policies to check targeted compliance
- Export compliance data
- Select any user's name for detailed status and resolution steps

When you select a user's name, you'll see their detailed compliance information including current status, domain verification, assigned policy, last policy fetch time, and Docker Desktop version.

## Resolve compliance issues

You can select a non-compliant user's name in the dashboard for recommended status resolution steps. The following sections are general resolution steps for non-compliant statuses:

### Non-compliant or outdated users

- Ask the user to fully quit and relaunch Docker Desktop
- Verify the user is signed in to Docker Desktop
- Confirm the user has Docker Desktop 4.40 or later

### Uncontrolled domain users

- Verify the user's email domain in your organization settings
- If the domain should be controlled, add and verify it, then wait for verification
- If the user is a guest and shouldn't be controlled, no action is needed

### No policy assigned users

- Assign the user to an existing policy
- Create a new user-specific policy for them
- Verify they're included in your organization's default policy scope

After users take corrective action, refresh the reporting dashboard to verify status changes.

## Policy update timing

Docker Desktop checks for policy updates:

- At startup
- Every 60 minutes while Docker Desktop is running
- When users restart Docker Desktop

Changes to policies in the Admin Console are available immediately, but users must restart Docker Desktop to apply them.

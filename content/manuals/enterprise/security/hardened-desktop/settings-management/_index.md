{{< summary-bar feature_name="Hardened Docker Desktop" >}}

Settings Management lets administrators configure and enforce Docker Desktop settings across end-user machines. It helps maintain consistent configurations and enhances security within your organization.

## Who should use Settings Management?

Settings Management is designed for organizations that:

- Need centralized control over Docker Desktop configurations
- Want to standardize Docker Desktop environments across teams
- Operate in regulated environments and must enforce compliance policies

## How Settings Management works

Administrators can define settings using one of these methods:

- [Admin Console](/manuals/enterprise/security/hardened-desktop/settings-management/configure-admin-console.md): Create and assign settings policies through the
Docker Admin Console. This provides a web-based interface for managing settings
across your organization.
- [`admin-settings.json` file](/manuals/enterprise/security/hardened-desktop/settings-management/configure-json-file.md): Place a configuration file on the
user's machine to enforce settings. This method works well for automated
deployments and scripted installations.

Enforced settings override user-defined configurations and can't be modified by developers.

## Configurable settings

Settings Management supports a wide range of Docker Desktop features, including:

- Proxy configurations
- Network settings
- Container isolation options
- Registry access controls
- Resource limits
- Security policies

For a complete list of settings you can enforce, see the [Settings reference](/manuals/enterprise/security/hardened-desktop/settings-management/settings-reference.md).

## Policy precedence

When multiple policies exist, Docker Desktop applies them in this order:

1. User-specific policies: Highest priority
1. Organization default policy: Applied when no user-specific policy exists
1. Local `admin-settings.json` file: Lowest priority, overridden by Admin Console policies

## Set up Settings Management

1. [Enforce sign-in](/manuals/enterprise/security/enforce-sign-in/_index.md) to
ensure all developers authenticate with your organization.
2. Choose a configuration method:
    - Use the `--admin-settings` installer flag on [macOS](/manuals/desktop/setup/install/mac-install.md#install-from-the-command-line) or [Windows](/manuals/desktop/setup/install/windows-install.md#install-from-the-command-line) to automatically create the `admin-settings.json`.
    - Manually create and configure the [`admin-settings.json` file](/manuals/enterprise/security/hardened-desktop/settings-management/configure-json-file.md).
    - Create a settings policy in the [Docker Admin Console](configure-admin-console.md).

After configuration, developers receive the enforced settings when they:

- Quit and relaunch Docker Desktop, then sign in
- Launch and sign in to Docker Desktop for the first time

> [!NOTE]
>
> Docker Desktop doesn't automatically prompt users to restart or re-authenticate after a settings change. You may need to communicate these requirements to your developers.

## Developer experience

When settings are enforced:

- Settings options appear grayed out in Docker Desktop and can't be modified through the Dashboard, CLI, or configuration files
- If Enhanced Container Isolation is enabled, developers can't use privileged containers or similar methods to alter enforced settings within the Docker Desktop Linux VM

This ensures consistent environments while maintaining a clear visual indication of which settings are managed by administrators.

## Limitations

Settings Management has the following limitations:

- Doesn't work in air-gapped or offline environments
- Not compatible with environments that restrict authentication with Docker Hub

## Next steps

Get started with Settings Management:

- [Configure Settings Management with the `admin-settings.json` file](configure-json-file.md)
- [Configure Settings Management with the Docker Admin Console](configure-admin-console.md)

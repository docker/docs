ECI prevents malicious containers from compromising Docker Desktop while maintaining full developer productivity.

This page shows you how to turn on Enhanced Container Isolation (ECI) and verify it's working correctly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have:

- A Docker Business subscription
- Docker Desktop 4.13 or later
- [Enforced sign-in](/manuals/enterprise/security/enforce-sign-in/_index.md) (for administrators managing organization-wide settings only)

## Enable Enhanced Container Isolation

### For developers

Turn on ECI in your Docker Desktop settings:

1. Sign in to your organization in Docker Desktop. Your organization must have
a Docker Business subscription.
1. Stop and remove all existing containers:

    ```console
    $ docker stop $(docker ps -q)
    $ docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
    ```

1. In Docker Desktop, go to **Settings** > **General**.
1. Select the **Use Enhanced Container Isolation** checkbox.
1. Select **Apply and restart**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> ECI doesn't protect containers created before turning on the feature. Remove existing containers before turning on ECI.

### For administrators

Configure Enhanced Container Isolation organization-wide using Settings Management:

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab name="Admin Console" >}}

1. Sign in to [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com) and select your organization.
1. Go to **Admin Console** > **Desktop Settings Management**.
1. [Create or edit a setting policy](/manuals/enterprise/security/hardened-desktop/settings-management/configure-admin-console.md).
1. Set **Enhanced Container Isolation** to **Always enabled**.

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab name="JSON file" >}}

1. Create an [`admin-settings.json` file](/manuals/enterprise/security/hardened-desktop/settings-management/configure-json-file.md) and add:

      ```json
      {
        "configurationFileVersion": 2,
        "enhancedContainerIsolation": {
          "value": true,
          "locked": true
        }
      }
      ```

1. Configure the following as needed:
    - `"value": true`: Turns on ECI by default (required)
    - `"locked": true`: Prevents developers from turning off ECI
    - `"locked": false`: Allows developers to control the setting

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Apply the configuration

For ECI settings to take effect:

- New installations: Users launch Docker Desktop and sign in
- Existing installations: Users must fully quit Docker Desktop and relaunch

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Restarting from the Docker Desktop menu isn't sufficient. Users must completely quit and reopen Docker Desktop.

You can also configure [Docker socket mount permissions](/manuals/enterprise/security/hardened-desktop/enhanced-container-isolation/config.md) for trusted images that need Docker API access.

## Verify Enhanced Container Isolation is active

After turning on ECI, verify it's working correctly using these methods.

### Check user namespace mapping

Run a container and examine the user namespace mapping:

```console
$ docker run --rm alpine cat /proc/self/uid_map
```

With ECI turned on:

```text
0     100000      65536
```

This shows the container's root user (0) maps to an unprivileged user (100000) in the Docker Desktop VM, with a range of 64K user IDs. Each container gets an exclusive user ID range for isolation.

With ECI turned off:

```text
0          0 4294967295
```

This shows the container root user (0) maps directly to the VM root user (0), providing less isolation.

### Check container runtime

Verify the container runtime being used:

```console
$ docker inspect --format='{{.HostConfig.Runtime}}' <container_name>
```

With ECI turned on, it turns `sysbox-runc`. With ECI turned off, it returns
`runc`.

### Test security restrictions

Verify that ECI security restrictions are active.

Test namespace sharing:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm --pid=host alpine
```

With ECI turned on, this command fails with an error about Sysbox containers
not being able to share namespaces with the host.

Test Docker socket access:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock alpine
```

With ECI turned on, this command fails unless you've configured Docker socket exceptions for trusted images.

## What users see with enforced ECI

When administrators enforce Enhanced Container Isolation through
Settings Management:

- The **Use Enhanced Container Isolation** setting appears turned on in
Docker Desktop settings.
- If set to `"locked": true`, the setting is locked and greyed out.
- All new containers automatically use Linux user namepsaces.
- Existing development workflows continue to work without modification.
- Users see `sysbox-runc` as the container runtime in `docker inspect` output.

## Next steps

Roles control what users can do in your organization. When you invite users, you assign them a role that determines their permissions for repositories, teams, and organization settings.

This page provides an overview of Docker roles and permissions for each role.

## Organization roles

Docker organizations have three main roles:

- Member: Non-administrative role with basic access. Members can view other organization members and pull images from repositories they have access to.
- Editor: Partial administrative access. Editors can create, edit, and delete repositories. They can also manage team permissions for repositories.
- Owner: Full administrative access. Owners can manage all organization settings, including repositories, teams, members, billing, and security features.

## Permissions by role

> [!NOTE]
>
> An owner role assigned at the company level has the same access as an owner role assigned at the organization level. For more information, see [Company overview](/admin/company/).

### Content and registry permissions

These permissions apply organization-wide, including all repositories in your organization's namespace.

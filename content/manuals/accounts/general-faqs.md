### What is a Docker ID?

A Docker ID is a username for your Docker account that lets you access Docker
products. To create a Docker ID you need one of the following:

- An email address
- A social account
- A GitHub account

Your Docker ID must be between 4 and 30 characters long, and can only contain
numbers and lowercase letters. You can't use any special characters or spaces.

For more information, see [Create a Docker ID](/accounts/create-account/).

### Can I change my Docker ID?

No. You can't change your Docker ID once it's created. If you need a different
Docker ID, you must create a new Docker account with a new Docker ID.

Docker IDs can't be reused after deactivation.

### What if my Docker ID is taken?

All Docker IDs are first-come, first-served except for companies that have a
U.S. Trademark on a username.

If you have a trademark for your namespace,
[Docker Support](https://hub.docker.com/support/contact/) can retrieve the
Docker ID for you.

### What's an organization name or namespace?

The organization name, sometimes referred to as the organization namespace or
the organization ID, is the unique identifier of a Docker organization. The
organization name can't be the same as an existing Docker ID.

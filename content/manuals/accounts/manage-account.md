You can centrally manage the settings for your Docker account using Docker Home. Here you can also take administrative actions for your account and manage your account security.

> [!TIP]
>
> If your account is associated with an organization that enforces single sign-on (SSO), you may not have permissions to update your account settings. You must contact your administrator to update your settings.

## Update general settings

1. Sign in to your [Docker account](https://app.docker.com/login).
2. In Docker Home, select your avatar in the top-right corner to open the drop-down.
3. Select **Account settings**.

From the Account settings page, you can take any of the following actions.

### Update account information

To update your account information, select the arrow icon. You can edit the following settings here:

- Full name
- Company
- Location
- Website
- Gravatar email: To add an avatar to your Docker account, create a [Gravatar account](https://gravatar.com/) and create your avatar. Next, add your Gravatar email to your Docker account settings. It may take some time for your avatar to update in Docker.

This information is visible on your account profile in Docker Hub.

Make your changes here, then select **Save** to save your settings.

### Update email address

To update your email address, select the arrow icon.

1. Enter your new email address.
2. Enter your password to confirm the change.

### Change your password

To change your password, select **Reset password**.

Follow the instructions in the password reset email.

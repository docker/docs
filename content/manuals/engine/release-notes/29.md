This page describes the latest changes, additions, known issues, and fixes for Docker Engine version 29.

For more information about:

- Changes to the Engine API, see [Engine API version history](/reference/api/engine/version-history.md).

## 29.0.0

For a full list of pull requests and changes in this release, refer to the relevant GitHub milestones:

- [docker/cli, 29.0.0 milestone](https://github.com/docker/cli/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A29.0.0)
- [moby/moby, 29.0.0 milestone](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A29.0.0)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Experimental support for nftables can now be enabled by setting Docker daemon's `firewall-backend`
> option to `nftables`.
> For more information, see [Docker Engine docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/firewall-nftables/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - containerd image store is now the default for **fresh installs**. This doesn't apply to daemons configured with `userns-remap` (see [moby#47377](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/47377)).

> [!WARNING]
> - `github.com/docker/docker` go module is deprecated in favor of separate go modules: `github.com/moby/moby/client` and `github.com/moby/moby/api`
> - `github.com/moby/moby` module is considered an **internal implementation detail** - the only supported public modules are `client` and `api`.
> - Starting with v29, all Docker Engine releases will be tagged with the `docker-` prefix - e.g. `docker-v29.0.0`.
>
> **This only affects users of the Go module github.com/docker/docker and package maintainers**

> [!WARNING]
> Minimum API version supported by the daemon is `v1.44` (matching the Docker v25.0).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Debian (.deb) packages for **armhf** (32-bit) are now built targeting ARMv7 CPUs.
> Consequently, these packages will no longer work on devices based on the older ARMv6 architecture.

> [!WARNING]
> Official packages **Raspbian (32-bit)** are no longer provided.
> Migration Options:
> For 64-bit devices, you can install the Debian arm64 packages.
> For 32-bit ARMv7 devices, you can use the Debian armhf packages.

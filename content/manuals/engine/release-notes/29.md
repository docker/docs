{{< release-date date="2025-11-10" >}}

For a full list of pull requests and changes in this release, refer to the relevant GitHub milestones:

- [docker/cli, 29.0.0 milestone](https://github.com/docker/cli/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A29.0.0)
- [moby/moby, 29.0.0 milestone](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A29.0.0)

> [!CAUTION]
> This release includes several breaking changes and deprecations. Review the release notes carefully before upgrading.

- Experimental support for nftables can now be enabled by setting Docker daemon's `firewall-backend` option to `nftables`. For more information, see [Docker Engine docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/firewall-nftables/).
- containerd image store is now the default for **fresh installs**. This doesn't apply to daemons configured with `userns-remap` (see [moby#47377](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/47377)).

### Breaking Changes

- The Go module `github.com/docker/docker` is deprecated in favor of `github.com/moby/moby/client` and `github.com/moby/moby/api`. The `github.com/moby/moby` module is considered an **internal implementation detail** - the only supported public modules are `client` and `api`.
  Starting with v29, releases are tagged with the `docker-` prefix (e.g., `docker-v29.0.0`). **This only affects Go module users and package maintainers.**
- The daemon now requires API version `v1.44` or later (Docker v25.0+).
- Debian armhf (32-bit) packages now target ARMv7 CPUs and will not work on ARMv6 devices.
- Official Raspbian (32-bit) packages are no longer provided. Use Debian arm64 packages for 64-bit devices, or Debian armhf packages for 32-bit ARMv7 devices.
- **cgroup v1 is deprecated.** Support continues until at least May 2029, but migrate to cgroup v2 as soon as possible. See [moby#51111](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/51111).
- Docker Content Trust was removed from the Docker CLI. Can be built as a separate plugin: https://github.com/docker/cli/blob/v29.0.0/cmd/docker-trust/main.go

---

### New

- `docker image load` and `docker image save` now supports multiple platform selection via `--platform` flag (e.g., `docker image load --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -i image.tar`). [docker/cli#6126](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/6126)

- Add support for `memory-swap` and `memory-swappiness` flags to `docker service create` and `docker service update` commands. [docker/cli#6619](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/6619)
- Allow Docker CLI to set the `GODEBUG` environment variable when the key-value pair (`"GODEBUG":"..."`) exists inside the Docker context metadata. [docker/cli#6371](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/6371)

### Bug fixes and enhancements

### Packaging updates

- client: remove legacy CBC cipher suites from client config. [moby/moby#50126](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50126)
- contrib: remove `editorconfig` as it was unmaintained. [moby/moby#50607](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50607)
- contrib: remove Dockerfile syntax highlighting files for `nano` and TextMate (`tmbundle`) as they were unmaintained and outdated. [moby/moby#50606](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50606)
- contrib: remove mkimage-xxx scripts as they were unmaintained and not tested. [moby/moby#50297](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50297)
- If Docker is downgraded to a version that does not have this support the network will become unusable, it must be deleted and re-created. [moby/moby#50114](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50114)
- The Windows overlay network driver now supports option `--dns`. [moby/moby#51229](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/51229)
- Update BuildKit to [v0.25.2](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/releases/tag/v0.25.2). [moby/moby#51397](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/51397)
- Update containerd to [v2.1.5](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v2.1.5). [moby/moby#51409](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/51409)

  containerd v2.1.5 now uses systemd's default `LimitNOFILE` for containers,
  changing the open file descriptor limit (`ulimit -n`) from `1048576` to
  `1024`. This extends a change introduced in Docker Engine v25.0 for build
  containers to all containers.

  This prevents programs that adjust behavior based on ulimits from consuming
  excessive memory when the limit is set to `infinity`. Containers now behave
  the same way as programs running on the host.

  If your workload needs a higher limit, use `--ulimit` with `docker run`, or
  set defaults in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "default-ulimits": {
      "nofile": {
        "Name": "nofile",
        "Soft": 1048576,
        "Hard": 1048576
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  For more information, see [moby#51485](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/51485).
- Update Go runtime to [1.25.4](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.25.4). [moby/moby#51418](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/51418), [docker/cli#6632](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/6632)
- Users can request a specific prefix size for networks allocated from the default pools by using the unspecified address, for example `--subnet 0.0.0.0/24 --subnet ::/96`. [moby/moby#50114](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50114)

- Add daemon option `--bridge-accept-fwmark`. Packets with this firewall mark will accepted by bridge networks, overriding Docker's iptables or nftables "drop" rules. [moby/moby#50476](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50476)
- api/types/system: deprecated top level `DiskUsage` fields for type specific fields. [moby/moby#51235](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/51235)
- Ensure bridge devices are removed when bridge network creation fails. [moby/moby#51147](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/51147)
- Ensure that Windows NAT networks are recreated with their original labels when the Engine restarts. [moby/moby#50447](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50447)
- Environment variables set on a container using legacy links are deprecated and aren't added automatically anymore. [moby/moby#50719](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50719)
  - The daemon can be started with `DOCKER_KEEP_DEPRECATED_LEGACY_LINKS_ENV_VARS=1` to get them back
  - Users are encouraged to stop relying on these as they're deprecated, and the escape hatch will be removed in a later version
- Fix a bug in NetworkDB which would sometimes cause entries to get stuck deleted on some of the nodes, leading to connectivity issues between containers on overlay networks. [moby/moby#50342](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50342)
- Fix a bug that could cause the Engine and another host process to bind the same UDP port. [moby/moby#50669](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50669)
- Fix a deadlock that could happen if a firewalld reload was processed while the bridge networking driver was starting up, or creating or deleting a network, or creating port-mappings. [moby/moby#50620](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50620)
- Fix an issue preventing container startup or selection of its network gateway when IPv6 is only disabled on a specific interface. [moby/moby#48971](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48971)
- For Linux, `docker info` now reports the firewall backend if available. [docker/cli#6191](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/6191)
- Greatly improve the reliability of overlay networking and the Swarm routing mesh. [moby/moby#50393](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50393)
- Improve the convergence rate of NetworkDB, part of the management plane for overlay networking, after bursts of updates. [moby/moby#50193](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50193)
- Improve the reliability of the overlay network driver. [moby/moby#50260](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50260)
- Improved error handling for connection of a container to a network. [moby/moby#50945](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50945)
- macvlan and IPvlan-l2 networks: no default gateway will be configured unless a `--gateway` is explicitly included in IPAM configuration. This addresses an issue which could cause container startup to fail in networks with IPv6 auto-configuration enabled. [moby/moby#50929](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50929)
- nftables: Docker will not enable IP forwarding on the host. If forwarding is needed by a bridge network, but not enabled, daemon startup or network creation will fail with an error. You must either enable forwarding and ensure firewall rules are in place to prevent unwanted forwarding between non-Docker interfaces. Or, use daemon option `--ip-forward=false` to disable the check, but some bridge network functionality including port forwarding may not work. See [Engine Docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/firewall-nftables) for more information about migration from iptables to nftables. [moby/moby#50646](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50646)
- On daemon startup, restart containers that share their network stacks before containers that need those stacks. [moby/moby#50327](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50327)
- Published ports are now always accessible in networks with gateway mode "routed". Previously, rules to open those ports were only added when the routed mode network was selected as the container's default gateway. [moby/moby#50140](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50140)
- Since 28.0.0, an `iptables` mangle rule for checksumming SCTP was only added if environment variable `DOCKER_IPTABLES_SCTP_CHECKSUM=1` was set. The rule has now been removed, the environment variable now has no effect. [moby/moby#50539](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50539)
- The iptables rules for bridge networks have been updated, including removal of the `DOCKER-ISOLATION-STAGE-1` and `DOCKER-ISOLATION-STAGE-2` chains. With these changes:. [moby/moby#49981](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/49981)
  - Containers can now access ports published to host addresses by containers in other networks when the userland-proxy is not running
  - Containers can now access ports on container addresses in other networks that have gateway mode "nat-unprotected"
- When dynamically linked, the Docker daemon now depends on libnftables. [moby/moby#51033](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/51033)
- Windows: `network inspect`: the HNS network name is now reported in option `com.docker.network.windowsshim.networkname` rather than the Docker network name, which was only reported after a daemon restart. [moby/moby#50961](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50961)
- Windows: when restoring networks on daemon restart, preserve their association with non-default IPAM drivers. [moby/moby#50649](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/50649)

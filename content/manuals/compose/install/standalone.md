This page contains instructions on how to install Docker Compose standalone on Linux or Windows Server, from the command line.

> [!WARNING]
>
> The Docker Compose standalone uses the `-compose` syntax instead of the current standard syntax `compose`.  
> For example, you must type `docker-compose up` when using Docker Compose standalone, instead of `docker compose up`.

## On Linux

1. To download and install the Docker Compose standalone, run:

   ```console
   $ curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/{{% param "compose_version" %}}/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

2. Apply executable permissions to the standalone binary in the target path for the installation.

   ```console
   $ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

3. Test and execute Docker Compose commands using `docker-compose`.

> [!TIP]
>
> If the command `docker-compose` fails after installation, check your path.
> You can also create a symbolic link to `/usr/bin` or any other directory in your path.
> For example:
> ```console
> $ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
> ```

## On Windows Server

Follow these instructions if you are [running the Docker daemon directly
on Microsoft Windows Server](/manuals/engine/install/binaries.md#install-server-and-client-binaries-on-windows) and want to install Docker Compose.

1.  Run PowerShell as an administrator.
    In order to proceed with the installation, select **Yes** when asked if you want this app to make changes to your device.

2.  Optional. Ensure TLS1.2 is enabled. 
    GitHub requires TLS1.2 for secure connections. If youâ€™re using an older version of Windows Server, for example 2016, or suspect that TLS1.2 is not enabled, run the following command in PowerShell:

    ```powershell
    [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
    ```

3. Download the latest release of Docker Compose ({{% param "compose_version" %}}). Run the following command:

    ```powershell
     Start-BitsTransfer -Source "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/{{% param "compose_version" %}}/docker-compose-windows-x86_64.exe" -Destination $Env:ProgramFiles\Docker\docker-compose.exe
    ```

    To install a different version of Docker Compose, substitute `{{% param "compose_version" %}}` with the version of Compose you want to use.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > On Windows Server 2019 you can add the Compose executable to `$Env:ProgramFiles\Docker`.
     Because this directory is registered in the system `PATH`, you can run the `docker-compose --version` 
     command on the subsequent step with no additional configuration.

4.  Test the installation.

    ```console
    $ docker-compose.exe version
    Docker Compose version {{% param "compose_version" %}}
    ```

  development solution that includes, Docker Engine, Docker CLI, Docker Compose,
  Docker Build/BuildKit, and Kubernetes.
- [Docker Hub](../docker-hub/_index.md): The world's largest cloud-based
  container registry.
- [Docker Build Cloud](../build-cloud/_index.md): Powerful cloud-based builders that accelerate build times by up to 39x.
- [Docker Scout](../scout/_index.md): Tooling for software supply chain security
  that lets you quickly assess image health and accelerate security improvements.
- [Testcontainers Cloud](https://testcontainers.com/cloud/docs): Container-based
  testing automation that provides faster tests, a unified developer experience,
  and more.

The following sections describe some of the key features included with your
Docker subscription plan or Legacy Docker plan.

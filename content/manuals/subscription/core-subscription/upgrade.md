When you upgrade to a paid subscription, you immediately have access to all the features and entitlements available in your new chosen subscription. For detailed information on features available in each subscription, see [Docker Pricing](https://www.docker.com/pricing).

## Upgrade your subscription 

1. Sign in to [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com).

2. Optional. If you're upgrading from a free user account to a Team subscription and want to keep your account name, [convert your user account into an organization](../../admin/convert-account.md).

3. Select your **avatar** to expand the drop-down menu.

4. Select **Billing**, then the account you want to upgrade.

5. On the **Billing Details** tab, select **Change plan** and then choose the plan you'd like to upgrade to.

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > If your current plan is a free plan, select **Buy now**.

6. Follow the on-screen instructions.

   If you have a coupon to use, you can enter it during this step.

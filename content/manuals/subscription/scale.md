Docker subscriptions let you scale your consumption as your needs evolve. Except
for legacy Docker subscription plans, all paid Docker subscriptions come with
access to Docker Hub, Docker Build Cloud, and Testcontainers Cloud with a base
amount of consumption. See [Docker subscriptions and features](./details.md) to
learn how much base consumption comes with each subscription. You can scale your
consumption at any time during your subscription period. All purchased
consumption expires at the end of your subscription term.

You can scale consumption for the following:

- Docker Build Cloud minutes
- Docker Testcontainers Cloud runtime minutes
- Docker Hub storage and image pulls

To better understand your needs, you can view your consumption at any time. For
more details, see [View Docker product
usage](../admin/organization/manage-products.md#view-docker-product-usage).

## Add Build Cloud minutes

TBD

You can pre-purchase build minutes by [contacting
sales](https://www.docker.com/pricing/contact-sales/). There is no overage or
on-demand option available.

## Add Docker Testcontainers Cloud runtime minutes

You can pre-purchase Testcontainers Cloud runtime minutes by [contacting
 sales](https://www.docker.com/pricing/contact-sales/). In addition to
pre-purchase, you are able to use as many minutes as you need on-demand. The
usage will be billed at the end of each monthly billing cycle. On-demand usage
is billed at a higher rate than pre-purchased capacity. To avoid on-demand
charges, pre-purchase additional minutes.

## Add Docker Hub storage or image pulls

TBD

{{< include "hub-limits.md" >}}

You can pre-purchase images pulls and storage by [contacting
sales](https://www.docker.com/pricing/contact-sales/).

In addition to pre-purchase, you are able to use as much resources as you need
on-demand. On-demand usage is billed at a higher rate than pre-purchased
capacity. To avoid on-demand charges, pre-purchase additional storage or image
pulls.

Docker subscriptions provide features and benefits for individual developers, teams, and enterprise businesses. This page explains how to set up subscriptions for personal accounts and organizations.

Before you begin, make sure you have a [Docker ID](../accounts/create-account.md). To learn more about what's included with each tier, see [Docker subscriptions and features](./details.md) and [Docker Pricing](https://www.docker.com/pricing/).

## Set up a Docker subscription for a personal account

When you [create your Docker ID](../accounts/create-account.md), you automatically get a Docker Personal subscription. This subscription includes essential Docker tools at no cost. If you want to continue with Docker Personal, no further action is needed. You can start using Docker Desktop, Docker Hub, and other tools immediately.

If you need additional features like Docker Build Cloud minutes and more Docker Scout repositories, see [Upgrade your subscription](./change.md#upgrade-your-subscription).

## Set up a Docker subscription for an organization

You can subscribe a new or existing organization to Docker Team or Business subscriptions. Only organization owners can manage billing for the organization.

1. [Create your Docker ID](../accounts/create-account.md) if you don't already have one.
1. [Create your organization](../admin/organization/orgs.md) or use an existing organization you own.
1. Choose and purchase a Docker Team or Business subscription for the organization.

To upgrade an existing organization's subscription, see [Upgrade your subscription](./change.md#upgrade-your-subscription).

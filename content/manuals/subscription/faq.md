For more information on Docker subscriptions, see [Docker subscription overview](_index.md).  

## Can I transfer my subscription from one user or organization account to another?

Subscriptions are non-transferable between accounts or organizations.

## Can I pause or delay my Docker subscription?

You can't pause or delay a subscription, but you can downgrade your subscription. If a subscription invoice isn't paid by the due date, there's a 15-day grace period starting from the due date.

## Does Docker offer academic pricing?

Contact the [Docker Sales Team](https://www.docker.com/company/contact) for information about academic pricing options.

## How can I contribute to Docker content?

Docker offers two content contribution programs:

- [Docker-Sponsored Open Source Program (DSOS)](../docker-hub/repos/manage/trusted-content/dsos-program.md) for open source projects
- [Docker Verified Publisher (DVP)](../docker-hub/repos/manage/trusted-content/dvp-program.md) for commercial publishers

You can also join the [Developer Preview Program](https://www.docker.com/community/get-involved/developer-preview/) or sign up for early access programs to participate in research and try new features.

## Volume pricing

Docker offers volume pricing for Docker Business subscriptions starting at 25 seats. Contact the [Docker Sales Team](https://www.docker.com/pricing/contact-sales/) for more information.

## Remove seats from your subscription

You can remove seats from your Team or Business subscription at any time. Changes apply to your next billing cycle, and unused portions aren't refundable.

For example, if you're billed on the 8th of every month for 10 seats and remove 2 seats on the 15th, the 2 seats remain available until your next billing cycle. Your payment for 8 seats begins on the next billing cycle.

You can add seats at anytime to your existing subscription.

When you add seats to your subscription in the middle of your billing cycle, you are charged a prorated amount for the additional seats.

### Volume pricing

Docker offers volume pricing for Docker Business subscriptions starting at 25 seats. Contact the [Docker Sales Team](https://www.docker.com/pricing/contact-sales/) for more information.

## Remove seats

You can remove seats from your Team or Business subscription at anytime.

If you remove seats in the middle of the billing cycle, changes apply in the next billing cycle. Any unused portion of the subscription for removed seats isn't refundable or creditable.

For example, if you receive your billing on the 8th of every month for 10 seats and you want to remove 2 seats on the 15th of the month, the 2 seats will be removed from your subscription the next month. Your payment for 8 seats begins on the next billing cycle. If you're on the annual subscription, the 2 seats are still available until the next year, and your payment for the 8 seats begins on the next billing cycle.

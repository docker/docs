## Add seats

{{< include "tax-compliance.md" >}}

You can add seats at anytime to your existing subscription.

When you add seats to your subscription in the middle of your billing cycle, you are charged a prorated amount for the additional seats.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> If you have a [sales-assisted Docker Business subscription](details.md#sales-assisted), contact your account manager to add seats to your subscription.

1. Sign in to the [Docker Billing Console](https://app.docker.com/billing/).
2. Select your account from the drop-down menu in the top-left.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > Accounts with a legacy subscription must be managed in Docker Hub. After
   > selecting your account, select the link to **Manage this subscription on
   > Docker Hub**.

3. Select **Add seats**.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete adding seats.

You can now add more members to your organization. For more information, see [Manage organization members](../admin/organization/members.md).

### Volume pricing

Docker offers volume pricing for Docker Business subscriptions starting at 25 seats. Contact the [Docker Sales Team](https://www.docker.com/pricing/contact-sales/) for more information.


## Remove seats

You can remove seats from your Team or Business subscription at anytime.

If you remove seats in the middle of the billing cycle, changes apply in the next billing cycle. Any unused portion of the subscription for removed seats isn't refundable or creditable.

For example, if you receive your billing on the 8th of every month for 10 seats and you want to remove 2 seats on the 15th of the month, the 2 seats will be removed from your subscription the next month. Your payment for 8 seats begins on the next billing cycle. If you're on the annual subscription, the 2 seats are still available until the next year, and your payment for the 8 seats begins on the next billing cycle.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > Accounts with a legacy subscription, that are managed in Docker Hub, can
   > directly select **Remove seats**.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete removing seats.

You can cancel the removal of seats before your next billing cycle. To do so, select **Cancel change**.

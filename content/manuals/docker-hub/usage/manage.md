Use the following steps to help optimize and manage your Docker Hub usage for
both individuals and organizations:

1. [View your Docker Hub usage](https://hub.docker.com/usage).

2. Use the Docker Hub usage data to identify which accounts consume the most
   data, determine peak usage times, and identify which images are related to
   the most data usage. In addition, look for usage trends, such as the
   following:

   - Inefficient pull behavior: Identify frequently accessed repositories to
     assess whether you can optimize caching practices or consolidate usage to
     reduce pulls.
   - Inefficient automated systems: Check which automated tools, such as CI/CD
     pipelines, may be causing higher pull rates, and configure them to avoid
     unnecessary image pulls.

3. Optimize image pulls by:

   - Using caching: Implement local image caching via
     [mirroring](/docker-hub/mirror/) or within your CI/CD pipelines to reduce
     redundant pulls.
   - Automating manual workflows: Avoid unnecessary pulls by configuring automated
     systems to pull only when a new version of an image is available.

4. Optimize your storage by:

    - Regularly auditing and removing repositories with untagged, unused, or outdated images.
    - Looking for private repositories in Hub storage that exceed your plan's limits.

5. Increase your limits by upgrading or purchasing additional consumption. For
   details, see [Scale your subscription](/manuals/subscription/scale.md).

6. For organizations, monitor and enforce organizational policies by doing the
   following:

   - Routinely [view Docker Hub usage](https://hub.docker.com/usage) to monitor usage.
   - [Enforce sign-in](/security/for-admins/enforce-sign-in/) to ensure that you
     can monitor the usage of your users and users receive higher usage limits.
   - Look for duplicate user accounts in Docker and remove accounts from your organization
   as needed.

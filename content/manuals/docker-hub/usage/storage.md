The following storage and repository limits apply based on your subscription, subject to fair use:

| Plan     | Public repositories | Public repository storage | Private repositories       |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Personal | Unlimited           | Unlimited                 | Up to 1 private repository |
| Pro      | Unlimited           | Unlimited                 | Unlimited                  |
| Team     | Unlimited           | Unlimited                 | Unlimited                  |
| Business | Unlimited           | Unlimited                 | Unlimited                  |

Personal plans exceeding 2 GB of storage will be blocked from pushing and pulling content from their private repository. To unblock, delete unused content to stay within the 2 GB limit or upgrade to a higher plan.

Any storage usage beyond the included amounts in each paid subscription tier
will be charged at an on-demand rate. For more details about storage
calcultations and billing, see [Docker Hub storage
pricing](/manuals/billing/docker-hub-pricing.md).

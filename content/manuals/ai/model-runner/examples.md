See some examples of complete workflows using Docker Model Runner.

## Sample project

You can now start building your generative AI application powered by Docker
Model Runner.

If you want to try an existing GenAI application, follow these steps:

1. Set up the sample app. Clone and run the following repository:

   ```console
   $ git clone https://github.com/docker/hello-genai.git
   ```

1. In your terminal, go to the `hello-genai` directory.

1. Run `run.sh` to pull the chosen model and run the app.

1. Open your app in the browser at the addresses specified in the repository
   [README](https://github.com/docker/hello-genai).

You see the GenAI app's interface where you can start typing your prompts.

You can now interact with your own GenAI app, powered by a local model. Try a
few prompts and notice how fast the responses are ‚Äî all running on your machine
with Docker.

## Use Model Runner in GitHub Actions

Here is an example of how to use Model Runner as part of a GitHub workflow.
The example installs Model Runner, tests the installation, pulls and runs a
model, interacts with the model via the API, and deletes the model.

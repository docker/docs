The [Docker MCP Catalog](https://hub.docker.com/catalogs/mcp) is a centralized, trusted registry for discovering, sharing, and running MCP-compatible tools. Seamlessly integrated into Docker Hub, it offers verified, versioned, and curated MCP servers packaged as Docker images. 

The catalog also solves common MCP server challenges:

- Environment conflicts: Tools often need specific runtimes that may clash with existing setups.
- Lack of isolation: Traditional setups risk exposing the host system.
- Setup complexity: Manual installation and configuration result in slow adoption.
- Inconsistency across platforms: Tools may behave unpredictably on different OSes.

With Docker, each MCP server runs as a self-contained container so it is portable, isolated, and consistent. You can launch tools instantly using Docker CLI or Docker Desktop, without worrying about dependencies or compatibility.

## Key features

- Over 100 verified MCP servers in one place
- Publisher verification and versioned releases
- Pull-based distribution using Dockerâ€™s infrastructure
- Tools provided by partners such as New Relic, Stripe, Grafana, and more

## How it works

Each tool in the MCP Catalog is packaged as a Docker image with metadata. Developers can:

- Discover tools via Docker Hub under the mcp/ namespace.
- Connect tools to their preferred agents with simple configuration through the [MCP Toolkit](toolkit.md)
- Pull and run tools using Docker Desktop or the CLI.

Each catalog entry provides:

- Tool description and metadata
- Version history
- Example configuration for agent integration

## Example: How to use an MCP server from Docker Hub

The following example uses the Puppeteer MCP server to take a screenshot of a website and invert the colors using Claude Desktop.

{{< tab name="Using the MCP Toolkit (Recommended)" >}}

1. Make sure you have [installed the Docker Desktop Docker MCP Toolkit extension](toolkit.md).
2. From the extension, search for the Puppeteer MCP server in the **MCP Servers** tab, and toggle it on to enable.
3. From the **MCP Clients** tab, select the **Connect** button for Claude Desktop. 
4. Within Claude Desktop, submit the following prompt using the Sonnet 3.5 model:

   ```text
   Take a screenshot of docs.docker.com and then invert the colors
   ```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab name="Manually set it up" >}}

1. Update the `claude_desktop_config.json` file to include the following configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "puppeteer": {
         "command": "docker",
         "args": [
           "run",
           "-i",
           "--rm",
           "-e",
           "DOCKER_CONTAINER",
           "mcp/puppeteer"
         ],
         "env": {
           "DOCKER_CONTAINER": "true"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
2. Restart Claude Desktop to apply the changed config file.
3. Submit the following prompt using the Sonnet 3.5 model:

   ```text
   Take a screenshot of docs.docker.com and then invert the colors
   ```

Once you've given your consent to use the new tools, Claude spins up the Puppeteer MCP server inside a container, navigates to the target URL, captures and modify the page, and returns the screenshot.

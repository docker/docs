The Docker MCP Toolkit is a Docker Desktop extension local that enables seamless setup, management, and execution of containerized MCP servers and their connections to AI agents. It removes the friction from tool usage by offering secure defaults, one-click setup, and support for a growing ecosystem of LLM-based clients. It is the fastest path from MCP tool discovery to local execution.

## Key features

- Cross-LLM compatibility: Works out of the box with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Continue.dev, and [Gordon](/manuals/ai/gordon/mcp/gordon-mcp-server.md).
- Integrated tool discovery: Browse and launch MCP servers that are available in the Docker MCP Catalog, directly from Docker Desktop.
- No manual setup: Skip dependency management, runtime setup, and manual server configuration.

## How it works

The **MCP Servers** tab lists all available containerized servers from the Docker MCP Catalog. Each entry includes:

- Tool name and description
- Partner/publisher
- Number of callable tools

To enable an MCP server, simply use the toggle switch to toggle it on.

The **MCP Clients** tab lets you connect your enabled MCP servers to supported agents. Connection is as simple as selecting **Connect**, so you can switch between LLM providers without altering your MCP server integrations or security configurations.

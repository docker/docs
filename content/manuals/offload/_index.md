{{< summary-bar feature_name="Docker Offload" >}}

Docker Offload is a fully managed service that lets you offload building and
running containers to the cloud using the Docker tools you already know. It
enables developers to work efficiently in virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI)
environments or systems that don't support nested virtualization, while also
providing cloud infrastructure for fast, consistent builds and compute-heavy
workloads like running LLMs or machine learning pipelines.

In the following topics, learn about Docker Offload, how to set it up, use it
for your workflows, and troubleshoot common issues.

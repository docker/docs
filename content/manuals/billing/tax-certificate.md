If you're a customer in the United States and are exempt from sales tax, you
can submit a valid tax exemption certificate to Docker Support.

If you're a global customer subject to VAT, make sure to include your
[VAT number](/billing/history/#include-your-vat-number-on-your-invoice)
along with your country prefix when you update your billing profile.

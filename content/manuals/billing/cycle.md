You can choose between a monthly or annual billing cycle when purchasing a
subscription. If you have a monthly billing cycle, you can choose to
switch to an annual billing cycle.

If you're on a monthly plan, you can switch to a yearly plan at any time.
However, switching from a yearly to a monthly cycle isn't supported.

When you change your billing cycle:

- Your next billing date reflects the new cycle. To find your next billing date,
see [View renewal date](history.md#view-renewal-date).
- Your subscription's start date resets. For example, if the monthly
subscription started on March 1 and ended on April 1, switching the billing
duration on March 15, 2024, resets the new start date to March 15, 2024, with
an end date of March 15, 2025.
- Any unused portion of your monthly subscription is prorated and applied as
credit toward an annual subscription. For example, if your monthly cost is $10
and you're used value is $5, when you switch to an annual cycle ($100), the
final charge is $95 ($100-$5).

Before you can start using Docker Build Cloud, you must add the builder to your local
environment.

## Prerequisites

To get started with Docker Build Cloud, you need to:

- Download and install Docker Desktop version 4.26.0 or later.
- Create a cloud builder on the [Docker Build Cloud Dashboard](https://app.docker.com/build/).
  - When you create the builder, choose a name for it (for example, `default`). You will use this name as `BUILDER_NAME` in the CLI steps below.

### Use Docker Build Cloud without Docker Desktop

To use Docker Build Cloud without Docker Desktop, you must download and install
a version of Buildx with support for Docker Build Cloud (the `cloud` driver).
You can find compatible Buildx binaries on the releases page of
[this repository](https://github.com/docker/buildx-desktop).

If you plan on building with Docker Build Cloud using the `docker compose
build` command, you also need a version of Docker Compose that supports Docker
Build Cloud. You can find compatible Docker Compose binaries on the releases
page of [this repository](https://github.com/docker/compose-desktop).

## Steps

You can add a cloud builder using the CLI, with the `docker buildx create`
command, or using the Docker Desktop settings GUI.

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab name="CLI" >}}

1. Sign in to your Docker account.

   ```console
   $ docker login
   ```

2. Add the cloud builder endpoint.

   ```console
   $ docker buildx create --driver cloud <ORG>/<BUILDER_NAME>
   ```

   Replace `<ORG>` with the Docker Hub namespace of your Docker organization (or your username if you are using a personal account), and `<BUILDER_NAME>` with the name you chose when creating the builder in the dashboard.

   This creates a local instance of the cloud builder named `cloud-ORG-BUILDER_NAME`.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > If your organization is `acme` and you named your builder `default`, use:
   > ```console
   > $ docker buildx create --driver cloud acme/default
   > ```


{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab name="Docker Desktop" >}}

1. Sign in to your Docker account using the **Sign in** button in Docker Desktop.

2. Open the Docker Desktop settings and navigate to the **Builders** tab.

3. Under **Available builders**, select **Connect to builder**.

The builder has native support for the `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`
architectures. This gives you a high-performance build cluster for building
multi-platform images natively.

## Firewall configuration

To use Docker Build Cloud behind a firewall, ensure that your firewall allows
traffic to the following addresses:

- 3.211.38.21
- https://auth.docker.io
- https://build-cloud.docker.com
- https://hub.docker.com

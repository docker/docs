{{< summary-bar feature_name="Company" >}}

A company can have multiple owners. Company owners have company-wide
observability and can manage company-wide settings that apply to all associated
organizations. In addition, company owners have the same access as organization
owners for all associated organizations. Unlike organization owners, company
owners don't need to be member of an organization. When company owners aren't a
member in an organization, they don't occupy a seat.

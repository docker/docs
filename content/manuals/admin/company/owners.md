A company can have multiple owners. Company owners have visibility across the
entire company and can manage settings that apply to all organizations under
that company. They also have the same access rights as organization owners but
donâ€™t need to be members of any individual organization.

> Company owners do not occupy a seat unless one of the following is true:

>   - They are added as a member of an organization under your company
>   - SSO is enabled

Learn to manage the organizations in a company using the Docker Admin Console.

## View all organizations

1. Sign in to the [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com) and choose
your company.
1. Select **Admin Console**, then **Organizations**.

The **Organizations** view displays all organizations under your company.

## Add seats to an organization

If you have a [self-serve](../../subscription/details.md#self-serve)
subscription that has no pending subscription changes, you can add seats using
Docker Home. For more information about adding seats,
see [Manage seats](/manuals/subscription/manage-seats.md#add-seats).

If you have a sales-assisted subscription, you must contact Docker support or
sales to add seats.

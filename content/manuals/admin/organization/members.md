## Accept invitation

When an invitation is to a user's email address, they receive
a link to Docker Hub where they can accept or decline the invitation.
To accept an invitation:

1. Navigate to your email inbox and open the Docker email with an invitation to
join the Docker organization.
1. To open the link to Docker Hub, select the **click here** link.

   > [!WARNING]
   >
   > Invitation email links expire after 14 days. If your email link has expired,
   > you can sign in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) with the email
   > address the link was sent to and accept the invitation from the
   > **Notifications** panel.

1. The Docker create an account page will open. If you already have an account, select **Already have an account? Sign in**.
If you do not have an account yet, create an account using the same email
address you received the invitation through.
1. Optional. If you do not have an account and created one, you must navigate
back to your email inbox and verify your email address using the Docker verification
email.
1. Once you are signed in to Docker Hub, select **My Hub** from the top-level navigation menu.
1. Select **Accept** on your invitation.

After accepting an invitation, you are now a member of the organization.

### Remove a member from a team

> [!NOTE]
>
> If your organization uses single sign-on (SSO) with [SCIM](/manuals/security/for-admins/provisioning/scim.md) enabled, you should remove members from your identity provider (IdP). This will automatically remove members from Docker. If SCIM is disabled, you must manually manage members in Docker.

Organization owners can remove a member from a team in Docker Hub or Admin Console. Removing the member from the team will revoke their access to the permitted resources.

To remove a member from a specific team with the Admin Console:

1. Sign in to [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com/) and select your
organization.

### Update a member role

Organization owners can manage [roles](/security/for-admins/roles-and-permissions/)
within an organization. If an organization is part of a company,
the company owner can also manage that organization's roles. If you have SSO enabled, you can use [SCIM for role mapping](/security/for-admins/provisioning/scim/).

To update a member role in the Admin Console:

1. Sign in to [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com/) and select your

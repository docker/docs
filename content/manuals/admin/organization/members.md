## Accept invitation

When an invitation is to a user's email address, they receive
a link to Docker Hub where they can accept or decline the invitation.
To accept an invitation:

1. Navigate to your email inbox and open the Docker email with an invitation to
join the Docker organization.
2. To open the link to Docker Hub, select the **click here** link.
3. The Docker create an account page will open. If you already have an account, select **Already have an account? Sign in**.
If you do not have an account yet, create an account using the same email
address you received the invitation through.
4. Optional. If you do not have an account and created one, you must navigate
back to your email inbox and verify your email address using the Docker verification
email.
5. Once you are signed in to Docker Hub, select **Organizations** from the top-level navigation menu.
6. The organizations page will display your invitation. Select **Accept**.

After accepting an invitation, you are now a member of the organization.

Learn how to manage members for your organization in Docker Hub and the Docker Admin Console.

## Invite members

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab name="Admin Console" >}}

Owners can invite new members to an organization via Docker ID, email address, or with a CSV file containing email addresses. If an invitee does not have a Docker account, they must create an account and verify their email address before they can accept an invitation to join the organization. When inviting members, their pending invitation occupies a seat.

### Invite members via Docker ID or email address

Use the following steps to invite members to your organization via Docker ID or email address.

1. Sign in to [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com) and select your organization.
1. Select **Members**, then **Invite**.
1. Select **Emails or usernames**.
1. Follow the on-screen instructions to invite members. Invite a maximum of 1000 members and separate multiple entries by comma, semicolon, or space.

> [!NOTE]
>
> When you invite members, you assign them a role. See [Roles and permissions](/manuals/security/for-admins/roles-and-permissions.md) for
details about the access permissions for each role.

Pending invitations appear in the table. Invitees receive an email with a link to Docker Hub where they can accept or decline the invitation.

### Invite members via CSV file

To invite multiple members to an organization via a CSV file containing email addresses:

1. Sign in to [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com) and select your organization.
1. Select **Members**, then **Invite**.
1. Select **CSV upload**.
1. Optional. Select **Download the template CSV file** to download an example CSV file. The following is an example of the contents of a valid CSV file.

```text
email
docker.user-0@example.com
docker.user-1@example.com
```

CSV file requirements:

- The file must contain a header row with at least one heading named email. Additional columns are allowed and are ignored in the import.
- The file must contain a maximum of 1000 email addresses (rows). To invite more than 1000 users, create multiple CSV files and perform all steps in this task for each file.

1. Create a new CSV file or export a CSV file from another application.

- To export a CSV file from another application, see the application’s documentation.
- To create a new CSV file, open a new file in a text editor, type email on the first line, type the user email addresses one per line on the following lines, and then save the file with a .csv extension.

1. Select **Browse files** and then select your CSV file, or drag and drop the CSV file into the **Select a CSV file to upload** box. You can only select one CSV file at a time.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If the amount of email addresses in your CSV file exceeds the number of available seats in your organization, you cannot continue to invite members. To invite members, you can purchase more seats, or remove some email addresses from the CSV file and re-select the new file. To purchase more seats, see [Add seats](/manuals/subscription/manage-seats.md) to your subscription or [Contact sales](https://www.docker.com/pricing/contact-sales/).

1. After the CSV file has been uploaded, select **Review**.

Valid email addresses and any email addresses that have issues appear. Email addresses may have the following issues:

- Invalid email: The email address is not a valid address. The email address will be ignored if you send invites. You can correct the email address in the CSV file and re-import the file.
- Already invited: The user has already been sent an invite email and another invite email will not be sent.
- Member: The user is already a member of your organization and an invite email will not be sent.
- Duplicate: The CSV file has multiple occurrences of the same email address. The user will be sent only one invite email.

1. Follow the on-screen instructions to invite members.

> [!NOTE]
>
> When you invite members, you assign them a role. See [Roles and permissions](/manuals/security/for-admins/roles-and-permissions.md) for
details about the access permissions for each role.

Pending invitations appear in the table. The invitees receive an email with a link to Docker Hub where they can accept or decline the invitation.

### Invite members via API

You can bulk invite members using the Docker Hub API. For more information, see the [Bulk create invites](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/hub/latest/#tag/invites/paths/~1v2~1invites~1bulk/post) API endpoint.

Organization owners can remove a member from a team in Docker Hub or Admin Console. Removing the member from the team will revoke their access to the permitted resources.

Organization owners can manage [roles](/security/for-admins/roles-and-permissions/)
within an organization. If an organization is part of a company,
the company owner can also manage that organization's roles. If you have SSO enabled, you can use [SCIM for role mapping](/security/for-admins/provisioning/scim/).

> [!NOTE]

before you can edit your role.

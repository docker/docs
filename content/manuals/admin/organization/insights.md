Insights helps administrators visualize and understand how Docker is used within
their organizations. With Insights, administrators can ensure their teams are
fully equipped to utilize Docker to its fullest potential, leading to improved
productivity and efficiency across the organization.

Key benefits include:

- Uniform working environment. Establish and maintain standardized
  configurations across teams.
- Best practices. Promote and enforce usage guidelines to ensure optimal
  performance.
- Increased visibility. Monitor and drive adoption of organizational
  configurations and policies.
- Optimized license use. Ensure that developers have access to advanced
  features provided by a Docker subscription.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Business subscription](../../subscription/details.md#docker-business)
- Administrators must [enforce sign-in](/security/for-admins/enforce-sign-in/) for users
- Insights enabled by your Customer Success Manager

## View Insights for organization users

{{< summary-bar feature_name="Admin console early access" >}}

To access Insights, you must contact your Customer Success Manager to have the

### Docker Desktop users

Track active Docker Desktop users in your domain, differentiated by license
status. This chart helps you understand the engagement levels within your
organization, providing insights into how many users are actively using Docker
Desktop. Note that users who opt out of analytics aren't included in the active
counts.

The chart contains the following data.

| Data | Description |

| Active user | The number of users that have actively used Docker Desktop and either signed in with a Docker account that has a license in your organization or signed in to a Docker account with an email address from a domain associated with your organization. <br><br>Users who donâ€™t sign in to an account associated with your organization are not represented in the data. To ensure users sign in with an account associated with your organization, you can [enforce sign-in](/security/for-admins/enforce-sign-in/). |
| Total organization members | The number of users that have used Docker Desktop, regardless of their Insights activity. |
| Users opted out of analytics | The number of users that are a member of your organization that have opted out of sending analytics. <br><br>When users opt out of sending analytics, you won't see any of their data in Insights. To ensure that the data includes all users, you can use [Settings Management](/desktop/hardened-desktop/settings-management/) to set `analyticsEnabled` for all your users. |
| Active users (graph) | The view over time for total active users. |

## Troubleshoot Insights

If youâ€™re experiencing issues with data in Insights, consider the following
solutions to resolve common problems.

* Update users to the latest version of Docker Desktop.

   Data is not shown for users using versions 4.16 or lower of Docker Desktop.
   In addition, older versions may not provide all data. Ensure all users have
   installed the latest version of Docker Desktop.

* Enable **Send usage statistics** in Docker Desktop for all your users.

   If users have opted out of sending usage statistics for Docker Desktop, then
   their usage data will not be a part of Insights. To manage the setting at
   scale for all your users, you can use [Settings
   Management](/desktop/hardened-desktop/settings-management/) and enable the
   `analyticsEnabled` setting.

* Ensure that users are using Docker Desktop and aren't using the standalone
  version of Docker Engine.

   Only Docker Desktop can provide data for Insights. If a user installs and
   uses Docker Engine outside of Docker Desktop, Docker Engine won't provide
   data for that user.

* Ensure that users are signing in to an account associated with your
  organization.

   Users who donâ€™t sign in to an account associated with your organization are
   not represented in the data. To ensure users sign in with an account
   associated with your organization, you can [enforce
   sign-in](/security/for-admins/enforce-sign-in/).

This section describes how to create an organization. Before you begin:

- You need a [Docker ID](/accounts/create-account/)
- Review the [Docker subscriptions and features](../../subscription/details.md) to determine what subscription to choose for your organization

The following section contains instructions on how to create a new organization. For prerequisites and
detailed instructions on converting an existing user account to an organization, see

## Merge organizations

> [!WARNING]
>
> If you are merging organizations, it is recommended to do so at the *end* of
> your billing cycle. When you merge an organization and downgrade another, you
> will lose seats on your downgraded organization. Docker does not offer
> refunds for downgrades.

If you have multiple organizations that you want to merge into one, complete the following:

1. Based on the number of seats from the secondary organization, [purchase additional seats](../../subscription/manage-seats.md) for the primary organization account that you want to keep.
1. Manually add users to the primary organization and remove existing users from the secondary organization.
1. Manually move over your data, including all repositories.
1. Once you're done moving all of your users and data, [downgrade](../../subscription/change.md) the secondary account to a free subscription. Note that Docker does not offer refunds for downgrading organizations mid-billing cycle.

> [!TIP]
>
> If your organization has a Docker Business subscription with a purchase order, contact Support or your Account Manager at Docker.

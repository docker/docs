## Merge organizations

> [!WARNING]
>
> If you are merging organizations, it is recommended to do so at the _end_ of
> your billing cycle. When you merge an organization and downgrade another, you
> will lose seats on your downgraded organization. Docker does not offer
> refunds for downgrades.

If you have multiple organizations that you want to merge into one, complete
the following steps:

1. Based on the number of seats from the secondary organization,
[purchase additional seats](../../subscription/manage-seats.md) for the
primary organization account that you want to keep.
1. Manually add users to the primary organization and remove existing users
from the secondary organization.
1. Manually move over your data, including all repositories.
1. Once you're done moving all of your users and data,
[downgrade](../../subscription/change.md) the secondary account to a free
subscription. Note that Docker does not offer refunds for downgrading
organizations mid-billing cycle.

> [!TIP]
>
> If your organization has a Docker Business subscription with a purchase
order, contact Support or your Account Manager at Docker.

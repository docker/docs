You can create teams for your organization in the Admin Console or Docker Hub,
and configure team repository access in Docker Hub.

A team is a group of Docker users that belong to an organization. An
organization can have multiple teams. An organization owner can create new
teams and add members to an existing team using their Docker ID or email
address. Members aren't required to be part of a team to be associated with an
organization.

The organization owner can add additional organization owners to help them
manage users, teams, and repositories in the organization by assigning them
the owner role.

## What is an organization owner?

An organization owner is an administrator who has the following permissions:

- Manage repositories and add team members to the organization
- Access private repositories, all teams, billing information, and
organization settings
- Specify [permissions](#permissions-reference) for each team in the
organization
- Enable [SSO](/manuals/enterprise/security/single-sign-on/_index.md) for the
organization

When SSO is enabled for your organization, the organization owner can
also manage users. Docker can auto-provision Docker IDs for new end-users or
users who'd like to have a separate Docker ID for company use through SSO
enforcement.

Organization owners can add others with the owner role to help them
manage users, teams, and repositories in the organization.

For more information on roles, see
[Roles and permissions](/manuals/enterprise/security/roles-and-permissions.md).

## Set team repository permissions

Organization owners can configure repository permissions on a per-team basis.
For example, you can specify that all teams within an organization have
"Read and Write" access to repositories A and B, whereas only specific
teams have "Admin" access.

Note that organization owners have full administrative access to all
repositories within the organization.

To give a team access to a repository:

1. Sign in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).
1. Select **My Hub** and choose your organization.
1. In the **Teams** section, select the team you want to configure repository
access for.
1. Select the **Permissions** tab and select a repository from the
**Repository** drop-down.
1. Choose a permission from the **Permissions** drop-down list and select
**Add**.

Organization owners can also assign members the editor role to grant partial
administrative access. For more information on the editor role, see
[Roles and permissions](/manuals/enterprise/security/roles-and-permissions.md).

### Permissions reference

- `Read-only` access lets users view, search, and pull a private repository
in the same way as they can a public repository.
- `Read & Write` access lets users pull, push, and view a repository. In
addition, it lets users view, cancel, retry or trigger builds.
- `Admin` access lets users pull, push, view, edit, and delete a
  repository. You can also edit build settings and update the repository’s
  description, collaborator permissions, public/private visibility, and delete.

Permissions are cumulative. For example, if you have "Read & Write" permissions,
you automatically have "Read-only" permissions.

The following table shows what each permission level allows users to do:

| Action | Read-only | Read & Write | Admin |
|:------------------:|:---------:|:------------:|:-----:|
| Pull a Repository | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View a Repository | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Push a Repository | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Edit a Repository | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Delete a Repository | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Update a Repository Description | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| View Builds | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Cancel Builds | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Retry Builds | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Trigger Builds | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Edit Build Settings | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

> [!NOTE]
>
> A user who hasn't verified their email address only has `Read-only` access to
the repository, regardless of the rights their team membership has given them.

## View team permissions for all repositories

To view a team's permissions across all repositories:

1. Sign in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).
1. Select **My Hub** and choose your organization.
1. Select **Teams** and choose your team name.
1. Select the **Permissions** tab, where you can view the repositories this
team can access.

## Delete a team

Organization owners can delete a team. When you remove a team from your
organization, this action revokes member access to the team's permitted
resources. It won't remove users from other teams that they belong to, and it
won't delete any resources.

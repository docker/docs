## Manage product access for your organization

Access to the Docker products included in your subscription is turned on by
default for all users. For an overview of products included in your
subscription, see

   Desktop. You can configure this setting in five states:
   - **Always enabled**: Docker Offload is always enabled and users cannot disable it. The Offload
     toggle is always visible in Docker Desktop header. Recommended for VDI environments where local Docker execution is
     not possible.
   - **Enabled**: Docker Offload is enabled by default but users can disable it in Docker Desktop
     settings. Suitable for hybrid environments.
   - **Disabled**: Docker Offload is disabled by default but users can enable it in Docker Desktop
     settings.
   - **Always disabled**: Docker Offload is disabled and users cannot enable it. The option is
     visible but locked. Use when Docker Offload is not approved for organizational use.
   - **User defined**: No enforced default. Users choose whether to enable or disable Docker Offload in their
     Docker Desktop settings.
1. If GPU support is enabled for your organization's subscription, configure the
   **Enable Docker Offload GPU Support** setting to control whether GPU support
   is available in Docker Desktop. You can configure this setting in five
   states:
   - **Always enabled**: GPU support is always enabled and users cannot disable it.
   - **Enabled**: GPU support is enabled by default but users can disable it in Docker Desktop
     settings.
   - **Disabled**: GPU support is disabled by default but users can enable it in Docker Desktop
     settings.

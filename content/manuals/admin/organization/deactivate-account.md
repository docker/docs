Learn how to deactivate a Docker organization, including required prerequisite
steps. For information about deactivating user
accounts, see [Deactivate a user account](../../accounts/deactivate-user-account.md).

> [!WARNING]
>
> All Docker products and services that use your Docker account or organization
account will be inaccessible after deactivating your account.

## Prerequisites

You must complete all the following steps before you can deactivate your
organization:

- Download any images and tags you want to keep:
  `docker pull -a <image>:<tag>`.
- If you have an active Docker subscription, [downgrade it to a free subscription](../../subscription/change.md).
- Remove all other members within the organization.
- Unlink your [GitHub and Bitbucket accounts](../../docker-hub/repos/manage/builds/link-source.md#unlink-a-github-user-account).
- For Business organizations, [remove your SSO connection](/manuals/enterprise/security/single-sign-on/manage.md#remove-an-organization).

## Deactivate

You can deactivate your organization using either the Admin Console or
Docker Hub.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This cannot be undone. Be sure you've gathered all the data you need from
your organization before deactivating it.

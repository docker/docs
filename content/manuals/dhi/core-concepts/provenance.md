## What is image provenance?

Image provenance refers to metadata that traces the origin, authorship, and
integrity of a container image. It answers critical questions such as:

- Where did this image come from?
- Who built it?
- Has it been tampered with?

Provenance establishes a chain of custody, helping you verify that the image
you're using is the result of a trusted and verifiable build process.

## Why image provenance matters

Provenance is foundational to securing your software supply chain. Without it, you risk:

- Running unverified or malicious images
- Failing to meet internal or regulatory compliance requirements
- Losing visibility into the components and workflows that produce your containers

With reliable provenance, you gain:

- Trust: Know that your images are authentic and unchanged.
- Traceability: Understand the full build process and source inputs.
- Auditability: Provide verifiable evidence of compliance and build integrity.

Provenance also supports automated policy enforcement and is a key requirement
for frameworks like SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts).

## How Docker Hardened Images support provenance

Docker Hardened Images (DHIs) are designed with built-in provenance to help you
adopt secure-by-default practices and meet supply chain security standards.

### Attestations

DHIs include [attestations](./attestations.md)â€”machine-readable metadata that
describe how, when, and where the image was built. These are generated using
industry standards such as [in-toto](https://in-toto.io/) and align with [SLSA
provenance](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/provenance/).

Attestations allow you to:

- Validate that builds followed the expected steps
- Confirm that inputs and environments meet policy
- Trace the build process across systems and stages

### Code signing

Each Docker Hardened Image is cryptographically [signed](./signatures.md) and
stored in the registry alongside its digest. These signatures are verifiable
proofs of authenticity and are compatible with tools like `cosign`, Docker
Scout, and Kubernetes admission controllers.

With image signatures, you can:

- Confirm that the image was published by Docker
- Detect if an image has been modified or republished
- Enforce signature validation in CI/CD or production deployments

## What is STIG?

[Security Technical Implementation Guides
(STIGs)](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/) are configuration standards published
by the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). They define security
requirements for operating systems, applications, databases, and other
technologies used in U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) environments.

STIGs help ensure that systems are configured securely and consistently to
reduce vulnerabilities. They are often based on broader requirements like the
DoD's General Purpose Operating System Security Requirements Guide (GPOS SRG).

## Why STIG guidance matters

Following STIG guidance is critical for organizations that work with or support
U.S. government systems. It demonstrates alignment with DoD security standards
and helps:

- Accelerate Authority to Operate (ATO) processes for DoD systems
- Reduce the risk of misconfiguration and exploitable weaknesses
- Simplify audits and reporting through standardized baselines

Even outside of federal environments, STIGs are used by security-conscious
organizations as a benchmark for hardened system configurations.

STIGs are derived from broader NIST guidance, particularly [NIST Special
Publication 800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/sp800), which defines a
catalog of security and privacy controls for federal systems. Organizations
pursuing compliance with 800-53 or related frameworks (such as FedRAMP) can use
STIGs as implementation guides that help meet applicable control requirements.

## How Docker Hardened Images help apply STIG guidance

Docker Hardened Images (DHIs) include STIG variants that are scanned against
custom STIG-based profiles and include signed STIG scan attestations. These
attestations can support audits and compliance reporting.

Docker creates custom STIG-based profiles for images based on the GPOS SRG and
DoD Container Hardening Process Guide. Because DISA has not published a STIG
specifically for containers, these profiles help apply STIG-like guidance to
container environments in a consistent, reviewable way and are designed to
reduce false positives common in container images.

## Identify images that include STIG scan results

Docker Hardened Images that include STIG scan results are labeled as **STIG** in
the Docker Hardened Images catalog.

To find DHI repositories with STIG image variants, [explore
images](../how-to/explore.md) and:

- Use the **STIG** filter on the catalog page
- Look for **STIG** labels on individual image listings

To find a STIG image variant within a repository, go to the **Tags** tab in the
repository, and find images labeled with **STIG** in the **Compliance** column.

## View and verify STIG scan results

Docker provides a signed [STIG scan
attestation](../core-concepts/attestations.md) for each STIG-hardened image.
These attestations include:

- A summary of the scan results, including the number of passed, failed, and not
  applicable checks
- The name and version of the STIG profile used
- Full output in both HTML and XCCDF (XML) formats

### View STIG scan attestations

You can retrieve and inspect a STIG scan attestation using the Docker Scout CLI:

```console
$ docker scout attest get \
  --predicate-type https://docker.com/dhi/stig/v0.1 \
  --verify \
  --predicate \
  <your-namespace>/dhi-<image>:<tag>
```

### Extract HTML report

To extract and view the human-readable HTML report:

```console
$ docker scout attest get <your-namespace>/dhi-<image>:<tag> \
  --predicate-type https://docker.com/dhi/stig/v0.1 \
  --verify \
  --predicate \
  | jq -r '.[0].output[] | select(.format == "html").content | @base64d' > stig_report.html
```

### Extract XCCDF report

To extract the XML (XCCDF) report for integration with other tools:

```console
$ docker scout attest get <your-namespace>/dhi-<image>:<tag> \
  --predicate-type https://docker.com/dhi/stig/v0.1 \
  --verify \
  --predicate \
  | jq -r '.[0].output[] | select(.format == "xccdf").content | @base64d' > stig_report.xml
```

### View STIG scan summary

To view just the scan summary without the full reports:

```console
$ docker scout attest get <your-namespace>/dhi-<image>:<tag> \
  --predicate-type https://docker.com/dhi/stig/v0.1 \
  --verify \
  --predicate \
  | jq -r '.[0] | del(.output)'
```

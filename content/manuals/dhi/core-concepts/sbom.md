## What is an SBOM?

An SBOM is a detailed inventory that lists all components, libraries, and
dependencies used in building a software application. It provides transparency
into the software supply chain by documenting each component's version, origin,
and relationship to other components. Think of it as a "recipe" for your
software, detailing every ingredient and how they come together.

Metadata included in an SBOM for describing software artifacts may include:

- Name of the artifact
- Version
- License type
- Authors
- Unique package identifier

## Why are SBOMs important?

In today's software landscape, applications often comprise numerous components
from various sources, including open-source libraries, third-party services, and
proprietary code. This complexity can obscure visibility into potential
vulnerabilities and complicate compliance efforts. SBOMs address these
challenges by providing a detailed inventory of all components within an
application.


The significance of SBOMs is underscored by several key factors:

- Enhanced transparency: SBOMs offer a comprehensive view of all components that
  constitute an application, enabling organizations to identify and assess risks
  associated with third-party libraries and dependencies.

- Proactive vulnerability management: By maintaining an up-to-date SBOM,
  organizations can swiftly identify and address vulnerabilities in software
  components, reducing the window of exposure to potential exploits.

- Regulatory compliance: Many regulations and industry standards now require
  organizations to maintain control over the software components they use. An
  SBOM facilitates compliance by providing a clear and accessible record.

- Improved incident response: In the event of a security breach, an SBOM
  enables organizations to quickly identify affected components and take
  appropriate action, minimizing potential damage.

## Docker Hardened Image SBOMs

Docker Hardened Images come with built-in SBOMs, ensuring that every component
in the image is documented and verifiable. These SBOMs are cryptographically
signed, providing a tamper-evident record of the image's contents. This
integration simplifies audits and enhances trust in the software supply chain.

## View SBOMs in Docker Hardened Images

To view the SBOM of a Docker Hardened Image, you can use the `docker scout sbom`
command. Replace `<image-name>:<tag>` with the image name and tag.

```console
$ docker scout sbom <image-name>:<tag>
```

## Verify the SBOM of a Docker Hardened Image

Since Docker Hardened Images come with signed SBOMs, you can use Cosign to
verify the authenticity and integrity of the SBOM attached to the image. This
ensures that the SBOM has not been tampered with and that the image's contents
are trustworthy.

To verify the SBOM of a Docker Hardened Image using Cosign, use the following command:

```console
$ cosign verify-attestation \
  --key https://registry.scout.docker.com/keyring/dhi/latest.pub \
  --type sbom \
  <image-reference>
```

For example, to verify the SBOM attestation for the dhi/node image:

```console
$ cosign verify-attestation \
  --key https://registry.scout.docker.com/keyring/dhi/latest.pub \
  --type sbom \
  registry.scout.docker.com/dhi/node@sha256:6de8ac9c07367652496bf926675425a22bf93e487cc2690d6778a82dd0159c4f
```

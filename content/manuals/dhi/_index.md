Docker Hardened Images (DHI) are minimal, secure, and production-ready container
base and application images maintained by Docker. Designed to reduce
vulnerabilities and simplify compliance, DHI integrates easily into your
existing Docker-based workflows with little to no retooling required.

DHI is available in two tiers: **DHI Free** provides core security features at
no cost, while **DHI Enterprise** adds SLA-backed support, compliance variants,
customization, and Extended Lifecycle Support for organizations with advanced
requirements.

Docker Hardened Images (DHI) are minimal, secure, and production-ready container
base and application images maintained by Docker. Designed to reduce
vulnerabilities and simplify compliance, DHI integrates easily into your
existing Docker-based workflows with little to no retooling required.

This section helps you understand what Docker Hardened Images are, how they're
built and tested, the different types available, and how responsibility is
shared between Docker and you as a user. For a complete list of DHI features and
capabilities, see [Features](/dhi/features/).

{{< summary-bar feature_name="Docker Hardened Images" >}}

Docker Hardened Images (DHIs) are designed to be secure by default, but like any
container image, it's important to scan them regularly as part of your
vulnerability management process.

You can scan DHIs using the same tools you already use for standard images, such
as Docker Scout, Grype, and Trivy. DHIs follow the same formats and standards
for compatibility across your security tooling. Before you scan an image, the image must
be mirrored into your organization on Docker Hub.

> [!NOTE]
>
> [Docker Scout](/manuals/scout/_index.md) is automatically enabled at no
> additional cost for all mirrored Docker Hardened Image repositories on Docker
> Hub. You can view scan results directly in the Docker Hub UI under your
> organization's repository.

## Docker Scout

Docker Scout is integrated into Docker Desktop and the Docker CLI. It provides
vulnerability insights, CVE summaries, and direct links to remediation guidance.

### Scan a DHI using Docker Scout

To scan a Docker Hardened Image using Docker Scout, run the following
command:

```console
$ docker scout cves <your-namespace>/dhi-<image>:<tag> --platform <platform>
```

Example output:

```plaintext
    v SBOM obtained from attestation, 101 packages found
    v Provenance obtained from attestation
    v VEX statements obtained from attestation
    v No vulnerable package detected
    ...
```

For more detailed filtering and JSON output, see [Docker Scout CLI reference](../../../reference/cli/docker/scout/_index.md).

### Automate DHI scanning in CI/CD with Docker Scout

Integrating Docker Scout into your CI/CD pipeline enables you to automatically
verify that images built from Docker Hardened Images remain free from known
vulnerabilities during the build process. This proactive approach ensures the
continued security integrity of your images throughout the development
lifecycle.

#### Example GitHub Actions workflow

The following is a sample GitHub Actions workflow that builds an image and scans
it using Docker Scout:

```yaml {collapse="true"}
name: DHI Vulnerability Scan

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "**" ]

env:
  REGISTRY: docker.io
  IMAGE_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}
  SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha || github.event.after }}

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
      pull-requests: write

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: |
          docker build -t ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ env.SHA }} .

      - name: Run Docker Scout CVE scan
        uses: docker/scout-action@v1
        with:
          command: cves
          image: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ env.SHA }}
          only-severities: critical,high
          exit-code: true
```

The `exit-code: true` parameter ensures that the workflow fails if any critical or
high-severity vulnerabilities are detected, preventing the deployment of
insecure images.

For more details on using Docker Scout in CI, see [Integrating Docker
Scout with other systems](/manuals/scout/integrations/_index.md).

## Grype

[Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) is an open-source scanner that checks
container images against vulnerability databases like the NVD and distro
advisories.

### Scan a DHI using Grype

After installing Grype, you can scan a Docker Hardened Image by pulling
the image and running the scan command:

```console
$ docker pull <your-namespace>/dhi-<image>:<tag>
$ grype <your-namespace>/dhi-<image>:<tag>
```

Example output:

```plaintext
NAME               INSTALLED              FIXED-IN     TYPE  VULNERABILITY     SEVERITY    EPSS%  RISK
libperl5.36        5.36.0-7+deb12u2       (won't fix)  deb   CVE-2023-31484    High        79.45    1.1
perl               5.36.0-7+deb12u2       (won't fix)  deb   CVE-2023-31484    High        79.45    1.1
perl-base          5.36.0-7+deb12u2       (won't fix)  deb   CVE-2023-31484    High        79.45    1.1
...
```

You should include the `--vex` flag to apply VEX statements during the scan,
which filter out known non-exploitable CVEs. For more information, see the [VEX
section](#use-vex-to-filter-known-non-exploitable-cves).

## Trivy

[Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) is an open-source vulnerability
scanner for containers and other artifacts. It detects vulnerabilities in OS
packages and application dependencies.

### Scan a DHI using Trivy

After installing Trivy, you can scan a Docker Hardened Image by pulling
the image and running the scan command:

```console
$ docker pull <your-namespace>/dhi-<image>:<tag>
$ trivy image <your-namespace>/dhi-<image>:<tag>
```

Example output:

```plaintext

```

You should include the `--vex` flag to apply VEX statements during the scan,
which filter out known non-exploitable CVEs. For more information, see the [VEX
section](#use-vex-to-filter-known-non-exploitable-cves).

## Use VEX to filter known non-exploitable CVEs

Docker Hardened Images include signed VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability
eXchange) attestations that identify vulnerabilities not relevant to the image’s
runtime behavior.

When using Docker Scout, these VEX statements are automatically applied and no
manual configuration needed.

To manually create a JSON file VEX attestation for tools that support it:

```console
$ docker scout attest get \
  --predicate-type https://openvex.dev/ns/v0.2.0 \
  --predicate \
  <your-namespace>/dhi-<image>:<tag> --platform <platform> > vex.json
```

For example:

```console
$ docker scout attest get \
  --predicate-type https://openvex.dev/ns/v0.2.0 \
  --predicate \
  docs/dhi-python:3.13 --platform linux/amd64 > vex.json
```

This creates a `vex.json` file containing the VEX statements for the specified
image. You can then use this file with tools that support VEX to filter out known non-exploitable CVEs.

For example, with Grype and Trivy, you can use the `--vex` flag to apply the VEX
statements during the scan:

```console
$ grype <your-namespace>/dhi-<image>:<tag> --vex vex.json
```

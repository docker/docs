{{< summary-bar feature_name="Docker Hardened Images" >}}

You can use a Docker Hardened Image (DHI) just like any other image on Docker
Hub. DHIs follow the same familiar usage patterns. Pull them with `docker pull`,
reference them in your Dockerfile, and run containers with `docker run`.

The key difference is that DHIs are security-focused and intentionally minimal
to reduce the attack surface. This means some variants don't include a shell or
package manager, and may run as a nonroot user by default.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You don't need to change your existing workflows. Whether you're pulling
> images manually, referencing them in your Dockerfiles, or integrating them
> into CI pipelines, DHIs work just like the images you already use.

After [mirroring](./mirror.md) a DHI to your organization's namespace, the image
becomes available for use. To find your mirrored repository, go to the original
image's page in the Hardened Images catalog and select **View in repository**,
to show a list of mirrored repositories.

## Considerations when adopting DHIs

Docker Hardened Images are intentionally minimal to improve security. If you're updating existing Dockerfiles or frameworks to use DHIs, keep the following considerations in mind:

| Feature            | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No shell or package manager | Runtime images donâ€™t include a shell or package manager. Use `-dev` or `-sdk` variants in build stages to run shell commands or install packages, and then copy artifacts to a minimal runtime image.                                         |
| Non-root runtime    | Runtime DHIs default to running as a non-root user. Ensure your application doesn't require privileged access and that all needed files are readable and executable by a non-root user.                                                             |
| Ports               | Applications running as non-root users can't bind to ports below 1024 in older versions of Docker or in some Kubernetes configurations. Use ports above 1024 for compatibility.                                             |
| Entry point         | DHIs may not include a default entrypoint or might use a different one than the original image you're familiar with. Check the image configuration and update your `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` directives accordingly.                                        |
| Multi-stage builds  | Always use multi-stage builds for frameworks: a `-dev` image for building or installing dependencies, and a minimal runtime image for the final stage.                                                                                                              |
| TLS certificates    | DHIs include standard TLS certificates. You do not need to manually install CA certs.                                                                                                                                                               |

If you're migrating an existing application, see  [Migrate an existing
application to use Docker Hardened Images](./migrate.md).

## Use a DHI in a Dockerfile

To use a DHI as the base image for your container, specify it in the `FROM` instruction in your Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM <your-namespace>/dhi-<image>:<tag>
```

Replace the image name and tag with the variant you want to use. For example,
use a `-dev` tag if you need a shell or package manager during build stages:

```dockerfile
FROM <your-namespace>/dhi-python:3.13-dev AS build
```

To learn how to explore available variants, see [Explore images](./explore.md).

> [!TIP]
>
> Use a multi-stage Dockerfile to separate build and runtime stages, using a
> `-dev` variant in build stages and a minimal runtime image in the final stage.

## Pull a DHI from Docker Hub

Just like any other image on Docker Hub, you can pull Docker Hardened Images
(DHIs) using tools such as the Docker CLI, the Docker Hub Registry API, or
within your CI pipelines.

The following example shows how to pull a DHI using the CLI:

```console
$ docker pull <your-namespace>/dhi-<image>:<tag>
```

You must have access to the image in your Docker Hub namespace. For more
information, see [Mirror a Docker Hardened Image](./mirror.md).

## Run a DHI

After pulling the image, you can run it using `docker run`. For example,
assuming the repository was mirrored to `dhi-python` in your organization
namespace, start a container and run a Python command:

```console
$ docker run --rm <your-namespace>/dhi-python:3.13 python -c "print('Hello from DHI')"
```

## Use a DHI in CI/CD pipelines

Docker Hardened Images work just like any other image in your CI/CD pipelines.
You can reference them in Dockerfiles, pull them as part of a pipeline step, or
run containers based on them during builds and tests.

Unlike typical container images, DHIs also include signed
[attestations](../core-concepts/attestations.md) such as SBOMs and provenance
metadata. You can incorporate these into your pipeline to support supply chain
security, policy checks, or audit requirements if your tooling supports it.

To strengthen your software supply chain, consider adding your own attestations
when building images from DHIs. This lets you document how the image was
built, verify its integrity, and enable downstream validation and [policy
enforcement](./policies.md) using tools like Docker Scout.

To learn how to attach attestations during the build process, see [Docker Build
Attestations](/manuals/build/metadata/attestations.md) .

## Use a static image for compiled executables

Docker Hardened Images include a `static` image repository designed specifically
for running compiled executables in an extremely minimal and secure runtime.

Use a `-dev` or other builder image in an earlier stage to compile your binary,
and copy the output into a `static` image.

The following example shows a multi-stage Dockerfile that builds a Go application
and runs it in a minimal static image:

```dockerfile
#syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

FROM <your-namespace>/dhi-golang:1.22-dev AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o myapp

FROM <your-namespace>/dhi-static:20230311
COPY --from=build /app/myapp /myapp
ENTRYPOINT ["/myapp"]
```

This pattern ensures a hardened runtime environment with no unnecessary
components, reducing the attack surface to a bare minimum.

## Use dev variants for framework-based applications

If you're building applications with frameworks that require package managers or
build tools (such as Python, Node.js, or Go), use a `-dev` variant during the
development or build stage. These variants include essential utilities like
shells, compilers, and package managers to support local iteration and CI
workflows.

Use `-dev` images in your inner development loop or in isolated CI stages to
maximize productivity. Once you're ready to produce artifacts for production,
switch to a smaller runtime variant to reduce the attack surface and image size.

The following example shows how to build a Python app using a `-dev` variant and
run it using the smaller runtime variant:

```dockerfile
#syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

FROM <your-namespace>/dhi-python:3.13-alpine3.21-dev AS builder

ENV LANG=C.UTF-8
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
ENV PATH="/app/venv/bin:$PATH"

WORKDIR /app

RUN python -m venv /app/venv
COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

FROM <your-namespace>/dhi-python:3.13-alpine3.21

WORKDIR /app

ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
ENV PATH="/app/venv/bin:$PATH"

COPY image.py image.png ./
COPY --from=builder /app/venv /app/venv

ENTRYPOINT [ "python", "/app/image.py" ]
```

This pattern separates the build environment from the runtime environment,
helping reduce image size and improve security by removing unnecessary tooling
from the final image.

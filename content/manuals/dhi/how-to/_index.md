This section provides practical, task-based guidance for working with Docker
Hardened Images (DHIs). Whether you're evaluating DHIs for the first time or
integrating them into a production CI/CD pipeline, these topics cover the key
tasks across the adoption journey, from discovery to debugging.

The topics are organized around the typical lifecycle of working with DHIs, but
you can use them as needed based on your specific workflow.

Explore the topics below that match your current needs.

## Discover

Explore available images and metadata in the DHI catalog.

## Adopt

Mirror trusted images, customize as needed, and integrate into your workflows.

{{< grid
  items="grid_adopt"
>}}

## Evaluate

Compare with other images to understand security improvements.

{{< grid
  items="grid_evaluate"
>}}

## Verify

Check signatures, SBOMs, and provenance, and scan for vulnerabilities.

{{< grid
  items="grid_verify"
>}}

## Govern

Enforce policies to maintain security and compliance.

{{< grid
  items="grid_govern"

{{< summary-bar feature_name="Docker Hardened Images" >}}

Docker Hardened Images (DHI) include signed attestations that verify the image’s
build process, contents, and security posture. These attestations are available
for each image variant and can be verified using
[cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/) or the Docker Scout CLI.

Docker's public key for DHI images is published at:

- https://registry.scout.docker.com/keyring/dhi/latest.pub
- https://github.com/docker-hardened-images/keyring

## Verify attestations with Docker Scout

You can use the Docker Scout CLI to list and retrieve attestations for Docker
Hardened Images, including images mirrored into your organization's namespace.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Before you run `docker scout attest` commands, ensure any image that you have
> pulled locally is up to date with the remote image. You can do this by running
> `docker pull`. If you don't do this, you may see `No attestation found`.

### Why use Docker Scout instead of cosign directly?

While you can use cosign to verify attestations manually, the Docker Scout CLI
offers several key advantages when working with Docker Hardened Images:

- Purpose-built experience: Docker Scout understands the structure of DHI
  attestations and image naming conventions, so you don't have to construct full
  image digests or URIs manually.

- Automatic platform resolution: With Scout, you can specify the platform (e.g.,
  `--platform linux/amd64`), and it automatically verifies the correct image
  variant. Cosign requires you to look up the digest yourself.

- Human-readable summaries: Scout returns summaries of attestation contents
  (e.g., package counts, provenance steps), whereas cosign only returns raw
  signature validation output.

- One-step validation: The `--verify` flag in `docker scout attest get` validates
  the attestation and shows the equivalent cosign command, making it easier to
  understand what's happening behind the scenes.

- Integrated with Docker Hub and DHI trust model: Docker Scout is tightly
  integrated with Docker’s attestation infrastructure and public keyring,
  ensuring compatibility and simplifying verification for users within the
  Docker ecosystem.

In short, Docker Scout streamlines the verification process and reduces the chances of human error, while still giving you full visibility and the option to fall back to cosign when needed.

### List available attestations

To list attestations for a mirrored DHI:

```console
$ docker scout attest list <your-org-namespace>/dhi-<image>:<tag> --platform <platform>
```

This command shows all available attestations, including SBOMs, provenance, vulnerability reports, and more.

### Retrieve a specific attestation

To retrieve a specific attestation, use the `--predicate-type` flag with the full predicate type URI:

```console
$ docker scout attest get \
  --predicate-type https://cyclonedx.org/bom/v1.5 \
  <your-org-namespace>/dhi-<image>:<tag> --platform <platform>
```

For example:

```console
$ docker scout attest get \
  --predicate-type https://cyclonedx.org/bom/v1.5 \
  docs/dhi-python:3.13 --platform linux/amd64
```

To retrieve only the predicate body:

```console
$ docker scout attest get \
  --predicate-type https://cyclonedx.org/bom/v1.5 \
  --predicate \
  <your-org-namespace>/dhi-<image>:<tag> --platform <platform>
```

For example:

```console
$ docker scout attest get \
  --predicate-type https://cyclonedx.org/bom/v1.5 \
  --predicate \
  docs/dhi-python:3.13 --platform linux/amd64
```

### Validate the attestation with Docker Scout

To validate the attestation using Docker Scout, you can use the `--verify` flag:

```console
$ docker scout attest get <image-name>:<tag> \
   --predicate-type https://scout.docker.com/sbom/v0.1 --verify
```

For example, to verify the SBOM attestation for the `dhi/node:20.19-debian12-fips-20250701182639` image:

```console
$ docker scout attest get docs/dhi-node:20.19-debian12-fips-20250701182639 \
   --predicate-type https://scout.docker.com/sbom/v0.1 --verify
```

### Show the equivalent cosign command

When using the `--verify` flag, it also prints the corresponding
[cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/) command to verify the image signature:

```console
$ docker scout attest get \
  --predicate-type https://cyclonedx.org/bom/v1.5 \
  --verify \
  <your-org-namespace>/dhi-<image>:<tag> --platform <platform>
```

For example:

```console
$ docker scout attest get \
  --predicate-type https://cyclonedx.org/bom/v1.5 \
  --verify \
  docs/dhi-python:3.13 --platform linux/amd64
```

If verification succeeds, Docker Scout prints the full `cosign verify` command.

Example output:

```console
    v SBOM obtained from attestation, 101 packages found
    v Provenance obtained from attestation
    v cosign verify registry.scout.docker.com/docker/dhi-python@sha256:b5418da893ada6272add2268573a3d5f595b5c486fb7ec58370a93217a9785ae \
        --key https://registry.scout.docker.com/keyring/dhi/latest.pub --experimental-oci11
    ...
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> When using cosign, you must first authenticate to both the Docker Hub registry
> and the Docker Scout registry.
>
> For example:
>
> ```console
> $ docker login
> $ docker login registry.scout.docker.com
> $ cosign verify \
>     registry.scout.docker.com/docker/dhi-python@sha256:b5418da893ada6272add2268573a3d5f595b5c486fb7ec58370a93217a9785ae \
>     --key https://registry.scout.docker.com/keyring/dhi/latest.pub --experimental-oci11
> ```

## Available DHI attestations

See [available
attestations](../core-concepts/attestations.md#available-attestations) for list
of attestations available for each DHI.

## Explore attestations on Docker Hub

You can also browse attestations visually when [exploring an image
variant](./explore.md#view-image-variant-details). The **Attestations** section
lists each available attestation with its:

- Type (e.g. SBOM, VEX)
- Predicate type URI
- Digest reference for use with `cosign`

These attestations are generated and signed automatically as part of the Docker
Hardened Image build process.

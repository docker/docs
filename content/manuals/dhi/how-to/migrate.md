{{< summary-bar feature_name="Docker Hardened Images" >}}

This guide helps you migrate your existing Dockerfiles to use Docker Hardened
Images (DHIs). DHIs are minimal and security-focused, which may require
adjustments to your base images, build process, and runtime configuration.

This guide focuses on migrating framework images, such as images for building
applications from source using languages like Go, Python, or Node.js. If you're
migrating application images, such as databases, proxies, or other prebuilt
services, many of the same principles still apply.

## Migration considerations

DHIs omit common tools such as shells and package managers to
reduce the attack surface. They also default to running as a nonroot user. As a
result, migrating to DHI typically requires the following changes to your
Dockerfile:

|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Base image         | Replace your base images in your Dockerfile with a Docker Hardened Image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Package management | Images intended for runtime, don't contain package managers. Use package managers only in images with a `dev` tag. Utilize multi-stage builds and copy necessary artifacts from the build stage to the runtime stage.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Non-root user      | By default, images intended for runtime, run as the nonroot user. Ensure that necessary files and directories are accessible to the nonroot user.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Multi-stage build  | Utilize images with a `dev` or `sdk` tags for build stages and non-dev images for runtime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| TLS certificates   | DHIs contain standard TLS certificates by default. There is no need to install TLS certificates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Ports              | DHIs intented for runtime run as a nonroot user by default. As a result, applications in these images can't bind to privileged ports (below 1024) when running in Kubernetes or in Docker Engine versions older than 20.10. To avoid issues, configure your application to listen on port 1025 or higher inside the container. |
| Entry point        | DHIs may have different entry points than images such as Docker Official Images. Inspect entry points for DHIs and update your Dockerfile if necessary.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| No shell           | DHIs intended for runtime don't contain a shell. Use dev images in build stages to run shell commands and then copy artifacts to the runtime stage.                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Migrate an existing application

The following steps outline the migration process.

### Step 1: Update the base image in your Dockerfile

Update the base image in your applicationâ€™s Dockerfile to a hardened image. This
is typically going to be an image tagged as `dev` or `sdk` because it has the tools
needed to install packages and dependencies.

The following example diff snippet from a Dockerfile shows the old base image
replaced by the new hardened image.

```diff
- ## Original base image
- FROM golang:1.22

+ ## Updated to use hardened base image
+ FROM <your-namespace>/dhi-golang:1.22-dev
```

### Step 2: Update the runtime image in your Dockerfile

To ensure that your final image is as minimal as possible, you should use a
[multi-stage build](/manuals/build/building/multi-stage.md). All stages in your
Dockerfile should use a hardened image. While intermediary stages will typically
use images tagged as `dev` or `sdk`, your final runtime stage should use a runtime image.

Utilize the build stage to compile your application and copy the resulting
artifacts to the final runtime stage. This ensures that your final image is
minimal and secure.

See the [Example Dockerfile migrations](#example-dockerfile-migrations) section for
examples of how to update your Dockerfile.

## Example Dockerfile migrations

The following migration examples show a Dockerfile before the migration and
after the migration.

### Go example

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab name="Before" >}}

```dockerfile
#syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

FROM golang:latest

WORKDIR /app
ADD . ./
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -ldflags="-s -w" --installsuffix cgo -o main .

ENTRYPOINT ["/app/main"]
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab name="After" >}}

```dockerfile
#syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# === Build stage: Compile Go application ===
FROM <your-namespace>/dhi-golang:1-alpine3.21-dev AS builder

WORKDIR /app
ADD . ./
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -ldflags="-s -w" --installsuffix cgo -o main .

# === Final stage: Create minimal runtime image ===
FROM <your-namespace>/dhi-golang:1-alpine3.21

WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/main  /app/main

ENTRYPOINT ["/app/main"]
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Node.js example

Docker Hardened Images are designed not only for security and compliance, but
also for operational and financial efficiency. With a model that charges per
repository and tooling that lets you customize images securely, you gain both
cost control and configuration flexibility.

## Repository mirroring on your terms

With Docker Hardened Images, you mirror entire repositories, each giving you
access to all supported tags, variants, and versions. You can choose which
repositories to mirror based on your needs.

This flexibility allows your organization to adapt as projects evolve, whether
you're spinning up new environments, consolidating runtimes, or managing costs
over time, without worrying about per-image or per-pull fees.

## Access all variants and versions

When you mirror a Docker Hardened Image repository, you gain access to all
supported tags in that repository, including multiple versions, base
distributions (such as Alpine and Debian), and dev/runtime variants. You can
freely choose the best tag for each use case without incurring additional cost.

This flexibility allows teams to adopt secure images without being limited by
billing complexity or image count.

## Customize images to fit your environment

In addition to cost flexibility, Docker Hardened Images let you securely
customize images before use. You can add your own packages, tools, certificates,
and configuration files using a guided customization workflow in Docker Hub.
These customizations are securely built and signed, so they integrate with your
compliance and CI/CD policies.

## Share access across your team

Once a repository is mirrored, anyone in your organization can pull, verify,
scan, and run images from it. There are no extra charges based on usage volume.
You mirror what you need, and your teams use it freely.

## Cost and operational efficiency for platform teams

The Docker Hardened Images model simplifies budgeting for platform and security
teams. Instead of tracking usage at the image or tag level, you manage spend
through the repositories you mirror. And since you can customize images within
Docker Hub itself, everything is in one place, reducing complexity and
operational overhead.

By aligning repository mirroring, team access, image customization, and cost,
Docker Hardened Images help you build securely and operate efficiently.

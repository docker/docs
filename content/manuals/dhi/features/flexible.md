Docker Hardened Images are designed not only for security and compliance, but
also for operational and financial efficiency. With a model that charges per
repository, you get precise control over what you use and what you pay for.

## Repository mirroring on your terms

With Docker Hardened Images, you mirror entire repositories, each giving you
access to all supported tags, variants, and versions. You can choose which
repositories to mirror based on your needs.

This flexibility allows your organization to adapt as projects evolve, whether
you're spinning up new environments, consolidating runtimes, or managing costs
over time, without worrying about per-image or per-pull fees.

## Access all variants and versions

When you mirror a Docker Hardened Image repository, you gain access to all
supported tags in that repository, including multiple versions, base
distributions (such as Alpine and Debian), and dev/runtime variants. You can
freely choose the best tag for each use case without incurring additional cost.

This flexibility allows teams to adopt secure images without being limited by
billing complexity or image count.

## Share access across your team

Once a repository is mirrored, anyone in your organization can pull, verify,
scan, and run images from it. There are no extra charges based on usage volume.
You mirror what you need, and your teams use it freely.

## Cost efficiency for platform teams

This model simplifies budgeting for platform and security teams. Rather than
tracking usage at the individual image or tag level, you manage your spend
through the repositories you control, aligning security enforcement, team access,
and cost in one place.

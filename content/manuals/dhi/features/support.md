Docker Hardened Images (DHI) are designed to provide flexibility and robust
support for enterprise environments, allowing teams to tailor images to their
specific needs while ensuring security and compliance.

## Enterprise-grade support and SLA-backed security updates

Docker provides comprehensive enterprise support for DHI users, ensuring rapid
response to security threats and operational issues:

- Enterprise support: Access to Docker's support team, with
  response times designed to safeguard mission-critical applications and
  maintain operational continuity.

- SLA-backed CVE mitigation: Docker aims to address Critical and High severity
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) within 7 working days of an
  upstream fix becoming available, with some exceptions. Faster than typical
  industry response times and backed by an enterprise-grade SLA, so your teams
  can rely on timely fixes to keep workloads secure.

This level of support ensures that organizations can rely on DHI for their
mission-critical applications, with the assurance that security and stability
are maintained proactively.

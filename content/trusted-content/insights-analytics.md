Insights and analytics provides usage analytics for Docker Verified
Publisher (DVP) and Docker-Sponsored Open Source (DSOS) images on Docker Hub. This includes self-serve access to metrics as both raw data and summary data for a desired time span. You can view the number of image pulls by tag or by digest, and get breakdowns by geolocation, cloud provider, client, and more.

## View the analytics data

You can find analytics data for your repositories on the **Insights and
analytics** dashboard at the following URL:
`https://hub.docker.com/orgs/{namespace}/insights`. The dashboard contains a
visualization of the usage data and a table where you can download
the data as CSV files.

To view data in the chart:

- Select the data granularity: weekly or monthly
- Select the time interval: 3, 6, or 12 months
- Select one or more repositories in the list

### Share analytics data

You can share the visualization with others using the **Share** icon above the chart.
This is a convenient way to share statistics with others in your organization.

![Chart share icon](./images/chart-share-icon.png)

Selecting the icon generates a link that's copied to your clipboard. The link
preserves the display selections you made. When someone follows the link, the
**Insights and analytics** page opens and displays the chart with the same
configuration as you had set up when creating the link.

## Exporting analytics data

You can export the analytics data either from the web dashboard, or using the
[DVP Data API](/docker-hub/api/dvp/). All members of an organization have access to the analytics data.

The data is available as a downloadable CSV file, in a weekly (Monday through
Sunday) or monthly format. Monthly data is available from the first day of the
following calendar month. You can import this data into your own systems, or you
can analyze it manually as a spreadsheet.

### Export data

Export usage data for your organization's images using the Docker Hub website by following these steps:

1.  Sign in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and select **Organizations**.

2.  Choose your organization and select **Insights and analytics**.

    ![Organization overview page, with the Insights and Analytics tab](./images/organization-tabs.png)

3.  Set the time span for which you want to export analytics data.

    The downloadable CSV files for summary and raw data appear on the right-hand
    side.

### Export data using the API

The HTTP API endpoints are available at:
`https://hub.docker.com/api/publisher/analytics/v1`. Learn how to export data
using the API in the [DVP Data API documentation](/docker-hub/api/dvp/).

## Data points

Export data in either raw or summary format. Each format contains different data
points and with different structure.

The following sections describe the available data points for each format. The
**Date added** column shows when the field was first introduced.

### Raw data

The raw data format contains the following data points. Each row in the CSV file
represents an image pull.

| Data point                    | Description                                                                                                  | Date added        |

### Summary data

There are two levels of summary data available:

- Repository-level, a summary of every namespace and repository
- Tag- or digest-level, a summary of every namespace, repository, and reference
  (tag or digest)

The summary data formats contain the following data points for the selected time
span:

| Data point        | Description                                             | Date added        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Unique IP address | Number of unique IP addresses, see [Privacy](#privacy). | January 1, 2022   |
| Pull by tag       | GET request, by digest or by tag.                       | January 1, 2022   |
| Pull by digest    | GET or HEAD request by digest, or HEAD by digest.       | January 1, 2022   |
| Version check     | HEAD by tag, not followed by a GET                      | January 1, 2022   |
| Owner             | The name of the organization that owns the repository.  | December 19, 2022 |

### Action classification rules

An action represents the multiple request events associated with a
`docker pull`. Pulls are grouped by category to make the data more meaningful
for understanding user behavior and intent. The categories are:

- Version check
- Pull by tag
- Pull by digest

Automated systems frequently check for new versions of your images. Being able
to distinguish between "version checks" in CI versus actual image pulls by a
user grants you more insight into your users' behavior.

The following table describes the rules applied for determining intent behind
pulls. To provide feedback or ask questions about these rules,

## Changes in data over time

The insights and analytics service is continuously improved to increase the
value it brings to publishers. Some changes might include adding new data
points, or improving existing data to make it more useful.

Changes in the dataset, such as added or removed fields, generally only apply
from the date of when the field was first introduced, and going forward.

Refer to the tables in the [Data points](#data-points) section to see from which
date a given data point is available.

## Privacy

This section contains information about privacy-protecting measures that ensures
consumers of content on Docker Hub remain completely anonymous.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> **Important**
>
> Docker never shares any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) as part of
> analytics data.
{ .important }

The summary dataset includes unique IP address count. This data point only
includes the number of distinct unique IP addresses that request an image.
Individual IP addresses are never shared.

The raw dataset includes user IP domains as a data point. This is the domain name
associated with the IP address used to pull an image. If the IP type is
`business`, the domain represents the company or organization associated with
that IP address (for example, `docker.com`). For any other IP type that's not
`business`, the domain represents the internet service provider or hosting
provider used to make the request. On average, only about 30% of all pulls
classify as the `business` IP type (this varies between publishers and images).

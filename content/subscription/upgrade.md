When you upgrade to a paid subscription, you immediately have access to all the features and entitlements available in your new chosen subscription. For detailed information on features available in each subscription, see [Docker Pricing](https://www.docker.com/pricing).

## Upgrade your subscription 

1. Sign in to your [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) account.

2. Optional: If you're upgrading from a free user account to a Team or Business subscription and want to keep your account name, [convert your user account into an organization](../docker-hub/convert-account.md).

3. From the **Billing** section, select the **Plan** tab.

4. Select **Change plan** and then choose the plan you'd like to upgrade to. 

    >**Note**
    >
    > If you are changing from:
    >- An annual Team subscription to an annual Business subscription, the start date and end date of your subscription remains unchanged. Any unused subscription is prorated and applied as credit towards the new annual period of the Business subscription.
    >- A monthly Team subscription to an annual Business subscription, the start date is reset. Any unused subscription is prorated and applied as credit towards the new annual period of the Business subscription.

5. Follow the on-screen instructions.

    If you have a [coupon](../billing/faqs.md#how-do-i-redeem-a-coupon) to use, you can enter it during this step.

When you upgrade to a paid subscription, you immediately have access to all the features and entitlements available in your new chosen subscription. For detailed information on features available in each subscription, see [Docker Pricing](https://www.docker.com/pricing).

## Upgrade your subscription 

1. Sign in to your [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) account.

2. Optional: If you're upgrading from a free user account to a Team subscription and want to keep your account name, [convert your user account into an organization](../admin/convert-account.md).

3. Select your avatar in the top-right corner of Docker Hub.

4. From the drop-down menu select **Billing**, then the account you want to upgrade.

5. In the **Plan** section, select **Change plan** and then choose the plan you'd like to upgrade to.

    >**Tip**

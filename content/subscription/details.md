You can do more with Docker with a Docker subscription, such as add collaborators, create scoped access tokens, and create private repositories. This page provides an overview of each subscription tier. To compare features available in each tier, see [Docker Pricing](https://www.docker.com/pricing/).

You can also subscribe to Docker Scout. See [Docker Scout subscriptions and features](./scout-details.md).

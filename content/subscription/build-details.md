You can enhance your teams' builds with a Build Cloud subscription. This page describes the features available for the different subscription tiers. To compare features available for each tier, see [Docker Build Cloud pricing](https://www.docker.com/products/build-cloud/#pricing).

## Docker Build Cloud Team

You can upgrade any tier to enhance your developers' experience with the following features:

The Docker Build Cloud Team subscription is tied to a Docker
[organization](../admin/organization/_index.md). To use the build minutes or
shared cache of a Docker Build Cloud Team subscription, users must be a part of
the organization associated with the subscription.

To learn how to buy this subscription, see [Docker Build Cloud billing](../billing/build-billing.md).

You can downgrade your Docker subscription at anytime before the renewal date. The unused portion of the subscription isn't refundable or creditable.

When you downgrade your subscription, access to paid features is available until the next billing cycle. The downgrade takes effect on the next billing cycle.

Before you downgrade to a free subscription, you may need to reduce the number of team members and convert any private repositories to public repositories or delete them. For information, see [Docker Pricing](https://www.docker.com/pricing).

> **Important**
>
> If you downgrade your personal account from a Pro subscription to a Personal subscription, note that [Personal subscriptions](details.md#docker-personal) don't include collaborators for private repositories, and only 1 private repository is included. When you downgrade, all collaborators will be removed and additional private repositories are locked.

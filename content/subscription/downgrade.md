> If you're subscribed to Docker Pro or subscribed to Docker Team or Business after October 23, 2023, you may have a different downgrade experience. When you downgrade a Docker Pro subscription purchased after this date, changes don't apply immediately and access to paid features is available until the next billing cycle. View the **Billing** details for your account to verify.

You can downgrade your Docker subscription at anytime before the renewal date. The unused portion of the subscription isn't refundable or creditable.

When you downgrade your subscription, changes apply immediately and you no longer have access to prior services.

Before you downgrade to a free subscription, you may need to reduce the number of team members and convert any private repositories to public repositories or delete them. For information, see [Docker Pricing](https://www.docker.com/pricing).

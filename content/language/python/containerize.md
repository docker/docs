## Prerequisites

* You have installed the latest version of [Docker Desktop](../../get-docker.md).
* You have a [git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads). The examples in this section use a command-line based git client, but you can use any client.

## Overview

This section walks you through containerizing and running a Python application.

## Get the sample application

The sample application uses the popular [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) framework.

Clone the sample application to use with this guide. Open a terminal, change directory to a directory that you want to work in, and run the following command to clone the repository:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/estebanx64/python-docker-example
```

## Initialize Docker assets

Now that you have an application, you can create the necessary Docker assets to
containerize your application. You can use Docker Desktop's built-in Docker Init
feature to help streamline the process, or you can manually create the assets.

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab name="Use Docker Init" >}}

Inside the `python-docker-example` directory, run the `docker init` command. `docker
init` provides some default configuration, but you'll need to answer a few
questions about your application. For example, this application uses FastAPI to
run. Refer to the following example to answer the prompts from `docker init` and
use the same answers for your prompts.

```console
$ docker init
Welcome to the Docker Init CLI!

This utility will walk you through creating the following files with sensible defaults for your project:
  - .dockerignore
  - Dockerfile
  - compose.yaml
  - README.Docker.md

Let's get started!

? What application platform does your project use? Python
? What version of Python do you want to use? 3.11.4
? What port do you want your app to listen on? 8000
? What is the command to run your app? python3 -m uvicorn app:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
```

Create a file named `.gitignore` with the following contents.

```text {collapse=true,title=".gitignore"}
# Byte-compiled / optimized / DLL files
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# C extensions
*.so

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab name="Manually create assets" >}}

If you don't have Docker Desktop installed or prefer creating the assets
manually, you can create the following files in your project directory.

Create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following contents.

```dockerfile {collapse=true,title=Dockerfile}
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# Comments are provided throughout this file to help you get started.
# If you need more help, visit the Dockerfile reference guide at
# https://docs.docker.com/go/dockerfile-reference/

ARG PYTHON_VERSION=3.11.4
FROM python:${PYTHON_VERSION}-slim AS base

# Prevents Python from writing pyc files.
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1

# Keeps Python from buffering stdout and stderr to avoid situations where
# the application crashes without emitting any logs due to buffering.
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

WORKDIR /app

# Create a non-privileged user that the app will run under.
# See https://docs.docker.com/go/dockerfile-user-best-practices/
ARG UID=10001
RUN adduser \
    --disabled-password \
    --gecos "" \
    --home "/nonexistent" \
    --shell "/sbin/nologin" \
    --no-create-home \
    --uid "${UID}" \
    appuser

# Download dependencies as a separate step to take advantage of Docker's caching.
# Leverage a cache mount to /root/.cache/pip to speed up subsequent builds.
# Leverage a bind mount to requirements.txt to avoid having to copy them into
# into this layer.
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip \
    --mount=type=bind,source=requirements.txt,target=requirements.txt \
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Switch to the non-privileged user to run the application.
USER appuser

# Copy the source code into the container.
COPY . .

# Expose the port that the application listens on.
EXPOSE 8000

# Run the application.
CMD python3 -m uvicorn app:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
```

Create a file named `compose.yaml` with the following contents.

```yaml {collapse=true,title=compose.yaml}
# Comments are provided throughout this file to help you get started.
# If you need more help, visit the Docker Compose reference guide at
# https://docs.docker.com/go/compose-spec-reference/

# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
services:
  server:
    build:
      context: .
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
```

Create a file named `.dockerignore` with the following contents.

```text {collapse=true,title=".dockerignore"}
# Include any files or directories that you don't want to be copied to your
# container here (e.g., local build artifacts, temporary files, etc.).
#
# For more help, visit the .dockerignore file reference guide at
# https://docs.docker.com/go/build-context-dockerignore/

Create a file named `.gitignore` with the following contents.

```text {collapse=true,title=".gitignore"}

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

You should now have the following contents in your `python-docker-example`
directory.

```text
├── python-docker-example/
│ ├── app.py
│ ├── requirements.txt
│ ├── .dockerignore
│ ├── .gitignore
│ ├── compose.yaml
│ ├── Dockerfile
│ └── README.md
```

To learn more about the files, see the following:
 - [Dockerfile](../../reference/dockerfile.md)
 - [.dockerignore](../../reference/dockerfile.md#dockerignore-file)
 - [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)
 - [compose.yaml](../../compose/compose-file/_index.md)

## Run the application

Inside the `python-docker-example` directory, run the following command in a
terminal.

```console
$ docker compose up --build
```

Open a browser and view the application at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). You should see a simple FastAPI application.

In the terminal, press `ctrl`+`c` to stop the application.

### Run the application in the background

You can run the application detached from the terminal by adding the `-d`
option. Inside the `python-docker-example` directory, run the following command
in a terminal.

```console
$ docker compose up --build -d
```

Open a browser and view the application at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

To see the OpenAPI docs you can go to [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

You should see a simple FastAPI application.

In the terminal, run the following command to stop the application.

```console
$ docker compose down
```

For more information about Compose commands, see the [Compose CLI
reference](../../compose/reference/_index.md).

The Ruby on Rails language-specific guide teaches you how to containerize a Ruby on Rails application using Docker. In this guide, you’ll learn how to:

* Containerize and run a Ruby on Rails application
* Set up a local environment to develop a Ruby on Rails application using containers
* Configure a CI/CD pipeline for a containerized Ruby on Rails application using GitHub Actions
* Deploy your containerized Ruby on Rails application locally to Kubernetes to test and debug your deployment

Start by containerizing an existing Ruby on Rails application.

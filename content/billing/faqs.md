### Where can I view my billing date?

Navigate to the **Plan** tab in your billing settings to view your current plan. You can find the billing date near the bottom-right of your plan details.

### What credit and debit cards are supported?

- Visa
- MasterCard
- American Express
- Discover
- JCB
- Diners
- UnionPay

### What happens if my subscription payment fails?

If your subscription payment fails, there is a grace period of 15 days, including the due date. Docker retries to collect the payment 3 times using the following schedule:

- 3 days after the due date
- 5 days after the previous attempt
- 7 days after the previous attempt

Docker also sends an email notification `Action Required - Credit Card Payment Failed` with an attached unpaid invoice after each failed payment attempt. 

Once the grace period is over and the invoice is still not paid, the subscription downgrades to a free plan and all paid features are disabled.

### What billing-related emails will I receive from Docker Hub?

Docker Hub sends the following billing-related emails:

- Confirmation of a new subscription.
- Confirmation of paid invoices. 
- Notifications of credit or debit card payment failures. 
- Notifications of credit or debit card expiration. 
- Confirmation of a cancelled subscription 
- Reminders of subscription renewals for annual subscribers. This is sent 14 days before the renewal date. 

### Does Docker offer academic pricing?

Contact the [Docker Sales Team](https://www.docker.com/company/contact).

### Do I need to do anything at the end of my subscription term?

No. All monthly and annual subscriptions are automatically renewed at the end of the term using the original form of payment.

### How do I redeem a coupon?

You can redeem a coupon for any paid Docker subscription. 

A coupon can be used when you:
- Sign up to a new paid subscription from a free subscription
- Upgrade an existing paid subscription 

You are asked to enter your coupon code when you confirm or enter your payment method. 

If you use a coupon to pay for a subscription, when the coupon expires, your payment method is charged the full cost of your subscription. If you don't have a saved payment method, your account downgrades to a free subscription.

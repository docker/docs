Build Cloud is a next-gen build tool that enables improved build speed, a shared build cache, and native multi-platform builds. Build Cloud is available for free with an existing Docker subscription. To get additional seats and increase your available build minutes, you can buy a subscription to enhance your builds.

If you don’t have a Docker Core subscription, you can buy Docker Build Cloud Team and create a team in Docker Build Cloud.

> **Tip**
>
> You can create a free Docker Personal account and [try Docker Build Cloud for free](/subscription/build-cloud/build-details#docker-personal). Team benefits aren't included.

This page describes how to add or update a payment method for your personal account or for an organization.

You can add a payment method or update your account's existing payment method at any time.

>**Important**
>
> If you want to remove all payment methods, you must first downgrade your subscription to a free plan. See [Downgrade](../../subscription/core-subscription/downgrade.md).

The following payment methods are supported:

- Visa
- MasterCard
- American Express
- Discover
- JCB
- Diners
- UnionPay

All currency, for example the amount listed on your billing invoice, is in United States dollar (USD).

## Manage payment method

### Personal account

1. Select your avatar in the top-right corner of Docker Hub.
2. From the drop-down menu select **Billing**.
3. Select the **Payment methods and billing history** link.
4. In the **Payment method** section, select **Add payment method**.
5. Enter your new payment information, then select **Add**.
6. Select the **Actions** icon, then select **Make default** to ensure that your new payment method applies to all purchases and subscriptions.
7. Optional. You can remove non-default payment methods by selecting the **Actions** icon. Then, select **Delete**.

### Organization

> **Note**
>
> You must be an organization owner to make changes to the payment information.

1. Select your avatar in the top-right corner of Docker Hub.
2. From the drop-down menu select **Billing**.
3. Select the organization account you want to update.
4. Select the **Payment methods and billing history** link.
5. In the **Payment Method** section, select **Add payment method**.
6. Enter your new payment information, then select **Add**.

## Failed payments

If your subscription payment fails, there is a grace period of 15 days, including the due date. Docker retries to collect the payment 3 times using the following schedule:

- 3 days after the due date
- 5 days after the previous attempt
- 7 days after the previous attempt

Docker also sends an email notification `Action Required - Credit Card Payment Failed` with an attached unpaid invoice after each failed payment attempt. 

Once the grace period is over and the invoice is still not paid, the subscription downgrades to a free plan and all paid features are disabled.

## Redeem a coupon

You can redeem a coupon for any paid Docker subscription.

A coupon can be used when you:
- Sign up to a new paid subscription from a free subscription
- Upgrade an existing paid subscription

You are asked to enter your coupon code when you confirm or enter your payment method.

If you use a coupon to pay for a subscription, when the coupon expires, your payment method is charged the full cost of your subscription. If you don't have a saved payment method, your account downgrades to a free subscription.

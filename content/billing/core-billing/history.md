In this section, learn how you can view your billing history, manage your invoices, and verify your renewal date. All monthly and annual subscriptions are automatically renewed at the end of the term using the original form of payment.

## Invoices

Your invoice includes the following:

- Invoice number
- Date of issue
- Date due
- Your bill to information
- Amount due
- Description of your order, quantity if applicable, unit price, and amount

Amounts are in USD.

The information listed in the **Bill** to section is based on your billing information. Not all fields are required. The billing information includes the following:

- Name (required) - the name of the administrator or company.
- Email address (required) - the email address that receives all billing-related emails for the account.
- Address (required)
- Phone number
- Tax ID or VAT

You canâ€™t make changes to a paid or unpaid billing invoice. When you update your billing information, this change won't update an existing invoice. If you need to update your billing information, make sure you do so before your subscription renewal date when your invoice is finalized. For more information, see [Update the billing information](details.md).

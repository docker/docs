If you're a customer in the United States and you're exempt from sales tax, you can register a valid tax exemption certificate with Docker's Support team. If you're a global customer subject to VAT, make sure that you provide your [VAT number](/billing/core-billing/history/#include-your-vat-number-on-your-invoice).

## Prerequisites

Before you submit your tax exemption certificate, ensure the following.

1. Your customer name matches the name on the exemption certificate
2. Your tax exemption certificate specifies Docker Inc as the Seller or Vendor and all applicable information is filled out
3. Your certificate is signed and dated, and the expiration date hasn't passed
4. You have a valid Docker ID/namespace(s) of the accounts that you want to apply the tax exemption certificate to

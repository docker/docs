Docker Scout lets users secure their software supply chain and continuously observe and improve their security posture. Docker Scout is free for up to 3 repositories. You can buy Docker Scout Team or Docker Scout Business to turn on Docker Scout for additional repositories. See [Docker Scout subscription and features](../subscription/scout-details.md) to select the plan that works for you.

In this section, learn how to buy and manage a Docker Scout Team subscription for your personal account or for an organization. If you're an organization with multiple teams, a Docker Scout Business plan may be better. To buy Docker Scout Business, [contact sales](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-scout/#contact-sales).

Docker Scout lets users secure their software supply chain and continuously observe and improve their security posture. Docker Scout is free for up to 3 repositories. You can buy Docker Scout Team or Docker Scout Business to turn on Docker Scout for additional repositories. See [Docker Scout subscription and features](../subscription/scout-details.md) to select the plan that works for you.

In this section, learn how to buy and manage a Docker Scout Team subscription for your personal account or for an organization. If you're an organization with multiple teams, a Docker Scout Business plan may be better. To buy Docker Scout Business, [contact sales](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-scout/#contact-sales).

## Manage your subscription

To access your subscription details, sign in to [Docker Scout](https://scout.docker.com/) with your Docker ID. Select **Settings**, then **Billing** for your personal account or organization that's subscribed.

Here you can find:

Renewals charge to the original credit card used to buy Docker Scout Team. Select the **Payment methods and billing history** link to update your payment information or view past invoices.

### Can I add sub-domains?

Yes, you can add sub-domains to your SSO, however all email addresses should also be on that domain. Verify that your DNS provider supports multiple TXT records for the same domain.

### Can the DNS provider configure it once for one-time verification and remove it later or will it be needed permanently?

You can do it one time to add it to a connection. If your organization ever changes IdPs and has to set up SSO again, your DNS provider will need to verify again.

### Is adding domain required to configure SSO? What domains should I be adding? And how do I add it?

Adding and verifying a domain is required to enable and enforce SSO. Select **Add Domain** and specify the email domains that are allowed to authenticate through your server. This should include all email domains users will use to access Docker. Public domains are not permitted, such as gmail.com, outlook.com, etc. Also, the email domain should be set as the primary email.

### If users are using their personal email, do they have to convert to using the organization's domain before they can be invited to join an organization? Is this just a quick change in their Hub account?

No, they don't. Though they can add multiple emails to a Docker ID if they choose to. However, they can only use that email address once across Docker. The other thing to note is that (as of January 2022) SSO doesn't work for multi domains as an MVP and it doesn't work for personal emails either.

### Since Docker ID is tracked from SAML, at what point is the login required to be tracked from SAML? Runtime or install time?

Runtime for Docker Desktop if they configure Docker Desktop to require authentication to their org.

### Do you support IdP-initiated authentication (e.g., Okta tile support)?

We don't support IdP-initiated authentication. Users must initiate login through Docker Desktop or Hub.

Docker Compose's integration for Amazon's Elastic Container Service and Azure Container Instances has retired. The integration documentation is no longer available through the Docker Docs site. 

However, you can still access the relevant documentation in the [Compose CLI repository](https://github.com/docker/compose-cli/tree/main/docs).

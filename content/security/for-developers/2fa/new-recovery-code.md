## Generate a new recovery code

1. Sign in to your Docker Hub account. 
2. Select your avatar and then from the drop-down menu, select **Account Settings**.
3. Navigate to the **Security** tab and select **Click here to generate a new code**.
4. Enter your password.

Your new recovery code is displayed. Remember to save your recovery code
and store it somewhere safe.

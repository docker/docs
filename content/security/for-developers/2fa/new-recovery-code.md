If you have lost your two-factor authentication recovery code and still have
access to your Docker account, you can generate a new recovery code.

1. Sign in to your [Docker account](https://account.docker.com/login).
2. Select your avatar and then from the drop-down menu, then select **My Account**.
3. Navigate to the **Security** section, then select the arrow icon.
4. Enter your password, then select **Confirm**.
5. Select **Generate new code**.

This generates a new code. Select the visibility icon to view the code. Remember to save your recovery code
and store it somewhere safe.

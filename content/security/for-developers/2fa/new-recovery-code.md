If you have lost your two-factor authentication recovery code and still have
access to your Docker Hub account, you can generate a new recovery code.

1. Sign in to your Docker Hub account. 
2. Select your avatar and then from the drop-down menu, select **My Account**.
3. Navigate to the **Security** tab and select **Click here to generate a new code**.
4. Enter your password.

Your new recovery code is displayed. Remember to save your recovery code
and store it somewhere safe.

If you have lost your two-factor authentication recovery code and still have
access to your Docker Hub account, you can generate a new recovery code.

1. Sign in to your Docker Hub account. 
2. Select your avatar and then from the drop-down menu, select **My Account**.
3. Navigate to the **Security** tab and select **Manage Two-Factor Authentication**.
4. Enter your password, then select **Confirm**.

In the **Manage recovery code** section, you can view your recovery code or generate a new code. Remember to save your recovery code and store it somewhere safe.

Organization and company owners can assign roles to individuals giving them different permissions in the organization. This section is for owners who want to learn about the defined roles and their permission scopes.

## Roles

When you invite users to your organization, you assign a role. A role is a collection of permissions. Roles define access to perform actions like creating repositories, pulling images, creating teams, and configuring organization settings.

The following roles are available to assign:

- **Member** - Non-administrative role. Members can view other members that are in the same organization.
- **Editor** - Partial administrative access to the organization. Editors can create, edit, and delete repositories. They can also edit an existing team's access permissions.
- **Organization owner** - Full organization administrative access. Organization owners can manage organization repositories, teams, members, settings, and billing.
- **Company owner** - In addition to the permissions of an organization owner, company owners can configure settings for their associated organizations.

Owners can manage roles for members of an organization on [Docker Hub](/admin/organization/members/#update-a-member-role), as well members of an [organization](/admin/organization/members/#update-a-member-role) or a [company](/admin/company/users/#update-a-member-role) in the [Docker Admin Console](/admin/).

## Permissions

The following sections describe the permissions for each role.

### Content and registry permissions

The following outlines content and registry permissions for member, editor, and organization owner roles. These permissions and roles apply to the entire organization, including all the repositories in the namespace for the organization.

Company owners have the same access as organization owners for all associated organizations. See [Company overview](/admin/company/).

| View repository activity                              | ❌     | ❌     | ✅                 |
| Set up Automated builds                               | ❌     | ❌     | ✅                 |

| Assign team permissions to repositories               | ❌     | ✅     | ✅                 |

When you add members to a team, you can manage their repository permissions. For team repository permissions, see [Create and manage a team permissions reference](/admin/organization/manage-a-team/#permissions-reference).

See the following diagram for an example of how permissions may work for a user. In this example, the first permission check is for the role: member or editor. Editors have administrative permissions for repositories across the namespace of the organization. Members may have administrative permissions for a repository if they're a member of a team that grants those permissions.

By default, members of your organization can use Docker Desktop without signing
in. When users don’t sign in as a member of your organization, they don’t
receive the [benefits of your organization’s
subscription](../../subscription/details.md) and they can circumvent [Docker’s
security features](../../desktop/hardened-desktop/_index.md) for your organization.

To ensure members of your organization always sign in, you can deploy a
`registry.json` configuration file to the machines of your users.

## How is sign-in enforced?

When Docker Desktop starts and it detects a `registry.json` file, the
following occurs:

- The following **Sign in required!** prompt appears requiring the user to sign
  in as a member of your organization to use Docker Desktop. ![Enforce Sign-in
  Prompt](../images/enforce-sign-in.png?w=400)
- When a user signs in to an account that isn’t a member of your organization,
  they will be automatically signed out and can’t use Docker Desktop. The user
  can select **Sign in** and try again.
- When a user signs in to an account that is a member of your organization, they
 can use Docker Desktop.
- When a user signs out, the **Sign in required!** prompt appears and they can
  no longer use Docker Desktop.

> **Enforcing Single Sign-On (SSO)**
>
> Enforcing sign-in to Docker Desktop isn't the same as enforcing SSO. To ensure
> that your users always sign in using their SSO credentials, you must also
> enforce SSO. For more details, see [Single Sign-On
> overview](single-sign-on/_index.md).


## Create a registry.json file to enforce sign-in

1. Ensure that the user is a member of your organization in Docker. For more
details, see [Manage members](/admin/organization/members/).

2. Create the `registry.json` file.

    Based on the user's operating system, create a file named `registry.json` at the following location and make sure the file can't be edited by the user.

    | Platform | Location |
    | --- | --- |
    | Windows | /ProgramData/DockerDesktop/registry.json |
    | Mac | /Library/Application Support/com.docker.docker/registry.json |
    | Linux | /usr/share/docker-desktop/registry/registry.json |

3. Specify your organization in the `registry.json` file.

    Open the `registry.json` file in a text editor and add the following contents, where `myorg` is replaced with your organization’s name. The file contents are case-sensitive and you must use lowercase letters for your organization's name.


    ```json
    {
    "allowedOrgs": ["myorg"]
    }
    ```

4. Verify that sign-in is enforced.

    Start Docker Desktop on the user’s machine and verify that the **Sign in
    required!** prompt appears.

## Alternative methods to create a registry.json file

You can also use the following alternative methods to create a `registry.json` file.

### Download a registry.json file from Docker Hub

In Docker Hub, you can download the `registry.json` file for your organization
or copy the specific commands to create the file for your organization. To
download the file or copy the commands, use the following steps.

1. Sign in to [Docker Hub](http://hub.docker.com/) as an organization owner.

2. Go to **Organizations** > ***Your Organization*** > **Settings**.

3. Select **Enforce Sign-in** and continue with the on-screen instructions for
   Windows, Mac, or Linux.

### Create a registry.json file when installing Docker Desktop

To create a `registry.json` file when installing Docker Desktop, use the following instructions based on your user's operating system.

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab name="Windows" >}}

To automatically create a `registry.json` file when installing Docker Desktop,
download `Docker Desktop Installer.exe` and run one of the following commands
from the directory containing `Docker Desktop Installer.exe`. Replace `myorg`
with your organization's name. You must use lowercase letters for your
organization's name.

If you're using PowerShell:

```powershell
PS> Start-Process '.\Docker Desktop Installer.exe' -Wait 'install --allowed-org=myorg'
```

If you're using the Windows Command Prompt:

```console
C:\Users\Admin> "Docker Desktop Installer.exe" install --allowed-org=myorg
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab name="Mac" >}}

To automatically create a `registry.json` file when installing Docker Desktop,
download `Docker.dmg` and run the following commands in a terminal from the
directory containing `Docker.dmg`. Replace `myorg` with your organization's name. You must use lowercase letters for your organization's name.

```console
$ sudo hdiutil attach Docker.dmg
$ sudo /Volumes/Docker/Docker.app/Contents/MacOS/install --allowed-org=myorg
$ sudo hdiutil detach /Volumes/Docker
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Create a registry.json file using the command line

To create a `registry.json` using the command line, use the following instructions based on your user's operating system.

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab name="Windows" >}}

To use the CLI to create a `registry.json` file, run the following PowerShell
command as an Admin and replace `myorg` with your organization's name. The file
contents are case-sensitive and you must use lowercase letters for your
organization's name.

```powershell
PS>  Set-Content /ProgramData/DockerDesktop/registry.json '{"allowedOrgs":["myorg"]}'
```

This creates the `registry.json` file at
`C:\ProgramData\DockerDesktop\registry.json` and includes the organization
information the user belongs to. Make sure that the user can't edit this file, but only the administrator can:

```console
PS C:\ProgramData\DockerDesktop> Get-Acl .\registry.json


    Directory: C:\ProgramData\DockerDesktop


Path          Owner                  Access
----          -----                  ------
registry.json BUILTIN\Administrators NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM Allow  FullControl...
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab name="Mac" >}}

To use the CLI to create a `registry.json` file, run the following commands in a
terminal and replace `myorg` with your organization's name. The file contents
are case-sensitive and you must use lowercase letters for your organization's
name.

```console
$ sudo mkdir -p "/Library/Application Support/com.docker.docker"
$ echo '{"allowedOrgs":["myorg"]}' | sudo tee "/Library/Application Support/com.docker.docker/registry.json"
```

This creates (or updates, if the file already exists) the `registry.json` file
at `/Library/Application Support/com.docker.docker/registry.json` and includes
the organization information the user belongs to. Make sure that the file has the
expected content, and that the user can't edit this file, but only the administrator can.

Verify that the content of the file contains the correct information:

```console
$ sudo cat "/Library/Application Support/com.docker.docker/registry.json"
{"allowedOrgs":["myorg"]}
```

Verify that the file has the expected permissions (`-rw-r--r--`) and ownership
(`root` and `admin`):

```console
$ sudo ls -l "/Library/Application Support/com.docker.docker/registry.json"
-rw-r--r--  1 root  admin  26 Jul 27 22:01 /Library/Application Support/com.docker.docker/registry.json
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab name="Linux" >}}

To use the CLI to create a `registry.json` file, run the following commands in a
terminal and replace `myorg` with your organization's name. The file contents
are case-sensitive and you must use lowercase letters for your organization's
name.

```console
$ sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/docker-desktop/registry
$ echo '{"allowedOrgs":["myorg"]}' | sudo tee /usr/share/docker-desktop/registry/registry.json
```

This creates (or updates, if the file already exists) the `registry.json` file
at `/usr/share/docker-desktop/registry/registry.json` and includes the
organization information to which the user belongs. Make sure the file has the
expected content and that the user can't edit this file, only the root can.

Verify that the content of the file contains the correct information:

```console
$ sudo cat /usr/share/docker-desktop/registry/registry.json
{"allowedOrgs":["myorg"]}
```

Verify that the file has the expected permissions (`-rw-r--r--`) and ownership
(`root`):

```console
$ sudo ls -l /usr/share/docker-desktop/registry/registry.json
-rw-r--r--  1 root  root  26 Jul 27 22:01 /usr/share/docker-desktop/registry/registry.json
```

## Deploy registry.json to multiple devices

The previous instructions explain how to create and deploy a `registry.json` file to a single device. To automatically deploy the `registry.json` to multiple devices, you must use a third-party solution, such as a mobile device management solution. You can use the previous instructions along with your third-party solution to remotely deploy the `registry.json` file, or remotely install Docker Desktop with the `registry.json` file. For more details, see the documentation of your third-party solution.

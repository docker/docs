Docker provides security guardrails for both administrators and developers.

If you're an administrator, you can enforce sign-in across Docker products for your developers, and
scale, manage, and secure your instances of Docker Desktop with DevOps security controls like Enhanced Container Isolation and Registry Access Management.

For both administrators and developers, Docker provides security-specific products such as Docker Scout, for securing your software supply chain with proactive image vulnerability monitoring and remediation strategies.

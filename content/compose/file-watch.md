> Compose Watch is available in Docker Compose version 2.22 and later.

Use `watch` to automatically update and preview your running Compose services as you edit and save your code. 

For many projects, this allows for a hands-off development workflow once Compose is running, as services automatically update themselves when you save your work.

`watch` adheres to the following file path rules:
* All paths are relative to the build context
* Directories are watched recursively
* Glob patterns aren't supported
* Rules from `.dockerignore` apply
  * Use `include` / `exclude` to override
  * Temporary/backup files for common IDEs (Vim, Emacs, JetBrains, & more) are ignored automatically
  * `.git` directories are ignored automatically

You don't need to switch on `watch` for all services in a Compose project. In some instances, only part of the project, for example the Javascript frontend, might be suitable for automatic updates.

## Compose Watch versus bind mounts

Compose supports sharing a host directory inside service containers. Watch mode does not replace this functionality but exists as a companion specifically suited to developing in containers.

More importantly, `watch` allows for greater granularity than is practical with a bind mount. Watch rules let you ignore specific files or entire directories within the watched tree.

For example, in a JavaScript project, ignoring the `node_modules/` directory has two benefits:
* Performance. File trees with many small files can cause high I/O load in some configurations
* Multi-platform. Compiled artifacts cannot be shared if the host OS or architecture is different to the container

For example, in a Node.js project, it's not recommended to sync the `node_modules/` directory. Even though JavaScript is interpreted, `npm` packages can contain native code that is not portable across platforms.

## Configuration

The `watch` attribute defines a list of rules that control automatic service updates based on local file changes.

Each rule requires, a `path` pattern and `action` to take when a modification is detected. There are two possible actions for `watch` and depending on
the `action`, additional fields might be accepted or required. 

Watch mode can be used with many different languages and frameworks.
The specific paths and rules will vary project to project, but the concepts remain the same. 

### `action`

#### Sync

If `action` is set to `sync`, Compose makes sure any changes made to files on your host automatically match with the corresponding files within the service container.

`sync` is ideal for frameworks that support "Hot Reload" or equivalent functionality.

More generally, `sync` rules can be used in place of bind mounts for many development use cases.

#### Rebuild

If `action` is set to `rebuild`, Compose automatically builds a new image with BuildKit and replaces the running service container.

The behavior is the same as running `docker compose up --build <svc>`.

Rebuild is ideal for compiled languages or as fallbacks for modifications to particular files that require a full
image rebuild (e.g. `package.json`).

### `path` and `target`

The `target` field controls how the path is mapped into the container.

For `path: ./app/html` and a change to `./app/html/index.html`:

* `target: /app/html` -> `/app/html/index.html`
* `target: /app/static` -> `/app/static/index.html`
* `target: /assets` -> `/assets/index.html`

## Example

This minimal example targets a Node.js application with the following structure:
```text
myproject/
├── web/
│   ├── App.jsx
│   └── index.js
├── Dockerfile
├── compose.yaml
└── package.json
```

```yaml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    command: npm start
    develop:
      watch:
        - action: sync
          path: ./web
          target: /src/web
          ignore:
            - node_modules/
        - action: rebuild
          path: package.json
```

In this example, when running `docker compose watch`, a container for the `web` service is launched using an image built from the `Dockerfile` in the project's root.
The `web` service runs `npm start` for its command, which then launches a development version of the application with Hot Module Reload enabled in the bundler (Webpack, Vite, Turbopack, etc).

After the service is up, the watch mode starts monitoring the target directories and files.
Then, whenever a source file in the `web/` directory is changed, Compose syncs the file to the corresponding location under `/src/web` inside the container.
For example, `./web/App.jsx` is copied to `/src/web/App.jsx`.

Once copied, the bundler updates the running application without a restart.

Unlike source code files, adding a new dependency can’t be done on-the-fly, so whenever `package.json` is changed, Compose
rebuilds the image and recreates the `web` service container.

This pattern can be followed for many languages and frameworks, such as Python with Flask: Python source files can be synced while a change to `requirements.txt` should trigger a rebuild.

## Use `watch`

1. Add `watch` sections to one or more services in `compose.yaml`.
2. Run `docker compose watch` to build and launch a Compose project and start the file watch mode.
3. Edit service source files using your preferred IDE or editor.

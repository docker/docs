You can use Docker Compose binary, `docker compose [-f <arg>...] [options]
[COMMAND] [ARGS...]`, to build and manage multiple services in Docker containers.

## Use `-f` to specify name and path of one or more Compose files

Use the `-f` flag to specify the location of a Compose configuration file.

### Specifying multiple Compose files

You can supply multiple `-f` configuration files. When you supply multiple
files, Compose combines them into a single configuration. Compose builds the
configuration in the order you supply the files. Subsequent files override and
add to their predecessors.

For example, consider this command line:

```console
$ docker compose -f compose.yml -f compose.admin.yml run backup_db
```

The `compose.yml` file might specify a `webapp` service.

```yaml
webapp:
  image: examples/web
  ports:
    - "8000:8000"
  volumes:
    - "/data"
```

If the `compose.admin.yml` also specifies this same service, any matching
fields override the previous file. New values, add to the `webapp` service
configuration.

```yaml
webapp:
  build: .
  environment:
    - DEBUG=1
```

When you use multiple Compose files, all paths in the files are relative to the
first configuration file specified with `-f`. You can use the
`--project-directory` option to override this base path.

Use a `-f` with `-` (dash) as the filename to read the configuration from
`stdin`. When `stdin` is used all paths in the configuration are
relative to the current working directory.

The `-f` flag is optional. If you don't provide this flag on the command line,
Compose traverses the working directory and its parent directories looking for a
`compose.yml` and a `compose.override.yml` file. You must supply
at least the `compose.yml` file. If both files are present on the same
directory level, Compose combines the two files into a single configuration.

The configuration in the `compose.override.yml` file is applied over and
in addition to the values in the `compose.yml` file.

### Specifying a path to a single Compose file

You can use the `-f` flag to specify a path to a Compose file that is not
located in the current directory, either from the command line or by setting up
a [COMPOSE_FILE environment variable](../environment-variables/envvars.md#compose_file) in your shell or
in an environment file.

For an example of using the `-f` option at the command line, suppose you are
running the [Compose Rails sample](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/tree/master/official-documentation-samples/rails/README.md), and
have a `compose.yml` file in a directory called `sandbox/rails`. You can
use a command like [docker compose pull](../../engine/reference/commandline/compose_pull.md) to get the
postgres image for the `db` service from anywhere by using the `-f` flag as
follows: `docker compose -f ~/sandbox/rails/compose.yml pull db`

Here's the full example:

```console
$ docker compose -f ~/sandbox/rails/compose.yml pull db
Pulling db (postgres:latest)...
latest: Pulling from library/postgres

Status: Downloaded newer image for postgres:latest
```

## Use `-p` to specify a project name

Each configuration has a project name which Compose can set in different ways. The level of precedence (from highest to lowest) for each method is as follows: 

1. The `-p` command line flag 
2. The [COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME environment variable][]
3. The top level `name:` variable from the config file (or the last `name:` from
  a series of config files specified using `-f`)
4. The `basename` of the project directory containing the config file (or
  containing the first config file specified using `-f`)
5. The `basename` of the current directory if no config file is specified

[COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME environment variable]: ../environment-variables/envvars.md#compose_project_name

Project names must contain only lowercase letters, decimal digits, dashes, and
underscores, and must begin with a lowercase letter or decimal digit. If the
`basename` of the project directory or current directory violates this
constraint, you must use one of the other mechanisms.

### Have multiple isolated environments on a single host

Compose uses a project name to isolate environments from each other. You can make use of this project name in several different contexts:

* On a dev host, to create multiple copies of a single environment, such as when you want to run a stable copy for each feature branch of a project
* On a CI server, to keep builds from interfering with each other, you can set
  the project name to a unique build number
* On a shared host or dev host, to prevent different projects, which may use the
  same service names, from interfering with each other

The default project name is the base name of the project directory. You can set
a custom project name by using the
[`-p` command line option](reference/index.md) or the
[`COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` environment variable](../environment-variables/envvars.md#compose_project_name).

The default project directory is the base directory of the Compose file. A custom value
for it can be defined with the `--project-directory` command line option.


## Use `--profile` to specify one or more active profiles

Calling `docker compose --profile frontend up` will start the services with the
profile `frontend` and services without specified profiles. You can also enable
multiple profiles, e.g. with `docker compose --profile frontend --profile debug up`
the profiles `frontend` and `debug` will be enabled.

See also [_Using profiles with Compose_](../profiles.md) and the
[`COMPOSE_PROFILES` environment variable](../environment-variables/envvars.md#compose_profiles).

## Set up environment variables

You can set [environment variables](../environment-variables/envvars.md) for various
`docker compose` options, including the `-f` and `-p` flags.

For example, the [COMPOSE_FILE environment variable](../environment-variables/envvars.md#compose_file)
relates to the `-f` flag, and `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`
[environment variable](../environment-variables/envvars.md#compose_project_name) relates to the `-p` flag.

Also, you can set some of these variables in an [environment file](../environment-variables/env-file.md).

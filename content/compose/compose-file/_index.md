The Compose Specification is the latest and recommended version of the Compose file format. It helps you define a [Compose file](../compose-application-model.md) which is used to configure your Docker applicationâ€™s services, networks, volumes, and more.

Legacy versions 2.x and 3.x of the Compose file format were merged into the Compose Specification. It is implemented in versions 1.27.0 and above (also known as Compose V2) of the Docker Compose CLI.

The Compose Specification on Docker Docs is the Docker Compose implementation. If you wish to implement your own version of the Compose Specification, see the [Compose Specication repository](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec).

> **Note**
>
> Compose V1 no longer receives updates and is not available in new releases of Docker Desktop.
>
> Compose V2 is included with all currently supported versions of Docker Desktop.
> For more information, see [Migrate to Compose V2](/compose/migrate).

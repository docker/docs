Software Bill of Material (SBOM) and provenance
[attestations](../../attestations/_index.md) add metadata about the contents of
your image, and how it was built.

Attestations are supported with version 4 and later of the
`docker/build-push-action`.

## Default provenance

The `docker/build-push-action` GitHub Action automatically adds provenance
attestations to your image, with the following conditions:

- If the GitHub repository is public, provenance attestations with `mode=max`
  are automatically added to the image.
- If the GitHub repository is private, provenance attestations with `mode=min`
  are automatically added to the image.
- If you're using the [`docker` exporter](../../exporters/oci-docker.md), or
  you're loading the build results to the runner with `load: true`, no
  attestations are added to the image. These output formats don't support
  attestations.

> **Warning**
>
> If you're using `docker/build-push-action` to build images for code in a
> public GitHub repository, the provenance attestations attached to your image
> by default contains the values of build arguments. If you're misusing build
> arguments to pass secrets to your build, such as user credentials or
> authentication tokens, those secrets are exposed in the provenance
> attestation. Refactor your build to pass those secrets using
> [secret mounts](../../../reference/cli/docker/buildx/build.md#secret)
> instead. Also remember to rotate any secrets you may have exposed.

## Max-level provenance

It's recommended that you build your images with max-level provenance
attestations. Private repositories only add min-level provenance by default,
but you can manually override the provenance level by setting the `provenance`
input on the `docker/build-push-action` GitHub Action to `mode=max`.

Note that adding attestations to an image means you must push the image to a
registry directly, as opposed to loading the image to the local image store of
the runner. This is because the local image store doesn't support loading
images with attestations.

```yaml
name: ci

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "main"

env:
  IMAGE_NAME: user/app

jobs:
  docker:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Extract metadata
        id: meta
        uses: docker/metadata-action@v4
        with:
          images: ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}

      - name: Build and push image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          provenance: mode=max
          tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
```

## SBOM

SBOM attestations aren't automatically added to the image. To add SBOM
attestations, set the `sbom` input of the `docker/build-push-action` to true.

Note that adding attestations to an image means you must push the image to a
registry directly, as opposed to loading the image to the local image store of
the runner. This is because the local image store doesn't support loading
images with attestations.

```yaml
name: ci

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "main"

env:
  IMAGE_NAME: user/app

jobs:
  docker:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Extract metadata
        id: meta
        uses: docker/metadata-action@v4
        with:
          images: ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}

      - name: Build and push image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          context: .
          sbom: true
          push: true
          tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
```

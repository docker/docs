Docker Build is one of Docker Engine's most used features. Whenever you are
creating an image you are using Docker Build. Build is a key part of your
software development life cycle allowing you to package and bundle your code and
ship it anywhere.

Docker Build is more than a command for building images, and it's not only about
packaging your code. It's a whole ecosystem of tools and features that support
not only common workflow tasks but also provides support for more complex and
advanced scenarios.

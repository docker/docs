You can create, inspect, and manage builders using `docker buildx` commands,
or [using Docker Desktop](#manage-builders-with-docker-desktop).

## Create a new builder

The default builder uses the [`docker` driver](../drivers/docker.md).
You can't manually create new `docker` builders, but you can create builders
that use other drivers, such as the
[`docker-container` driver](../drivers/docker-container.md),
which runs the BuildKit daemon in a container.

Use the
[`docker buildx create`](../../reference/cli/docker/buildx/create.md)
command to create a builder.

```console
$ docker buildx create --name=<builder-name>
```

Buildx uses the `docker-container` driver by default if you omit the `--driver`
flag. For more information about available drivers, see
[Build drivers](../drivers/index.md).

## List available builders

Use `docker buildx ls` to see builder instances available on your system, and
the drivers they're using.

```console
$ docker buildx ls
NAME/NODE       DRIVER/ENDPOINT      STATUS   BUILDKIT PLATFORMS
default *       docker
  default       default              running  v0.11.6  linux/amd64, linux/amd64/v2, linux/amd64/v3, linux/386
my_builder      docker-container
  my_builder0   default              running  v0.11.6  linux/amd64, linux/amd64/v2, linux/amd64/v3, linux/386
```

The asterisk (`*`) next to the builder name indicates the
[selected builder](index.md#selected-builder).

## Inspect a builder

To inspect a builder with the CLI, use `docker buildx inspect <name>`.
You can only inspect a builder if the builder is active.
You can add the `--bootstrap` flag to the command to start the builder.

```console
$ docker buildx inspect --bootstrap my_builder
[+] Building 1.7s (1/1) FINISHED

```

If you want to see how much disk space a builder is using, use the
`docker buildx du` command. By default, this command shows the total disk usage
for all available builders. To see usage for a specific builder, use the
`--builder` flag.

```console
$ docker buildx du --builder my_builder

## Remove a builder

Use the
[`docker buildx remove`](../../reference/cli/docker/buildx/create.md)
command to remove a builder.

```console
$ docker buildx rm <builder-name>
```

If you remove your currently selected builder,
the default `docker` builder is automatically selected.
You can't remove the default builder.

Local build cache for the builder is also removed.

### Removing remote builders

Removing a remote builder doesn't affect the remote build cache.
It also doesn't stop the remote BuildKit daemon.
It only removes your connection to the builder.

## Manage builders with Docker Desktop

If you have turned on the
[Docker Desktop Builds view](../../desktop/use-desktop/builds.md),
you can inspect builders in Docker Desktop settings. See:

- [Change settings, Windows](../../desktop/settings/windows.md#builders)
- [Change settings, Mac](../../desktop/settings/mac.md#builders)
- [Change settings, Linux](../../desktop/settings/linux.md#builders)

- The **Learning Center** now supports in-product walkthroughs.
- Docker init (Beta) now supports Node.js and Python.
- Faster networking between VM and host on macOS.
- You can now inspect and analyze remote images from Docker Desktop without pulling them.
- Usability and performance improvements to the **Artifactory images** view.

### Removed

- Removed `docker scan` command. To continue learning about the vulnerabilities of your images, and many other features, use the new `docker scout` command. Run `docker scout --help`, or [read the docs to learn more](../engine/reference/commandline/scout.md).

### Upgrades

- [Docker Engine v23.0.5](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/23.0/#2305)
- [Compose 2.17.3](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/v2.17.3)

- [Go v1.20.3](https://github.com/golang/go/releases/tag/go1.20.3)

### Bug fixes and enhancements

#### For all platforms

- Improved `docker scout compare` command to compare two images, now also aliased under `docker scout diff`.
- Added more details to dashboard errors when a `docker-compose` action fails ([docker/for-win#13378](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/13378)).
- Added support for setting HTTP proxy configuration during installation. This can be done via the `--proxy-http-mode`, `--overrider-proxy-http`, `--override-proxy-https` and `--override-proxy-exclude` installer flags in the case of installation from the CLI on [Mac](install/mac-install.md#install-from-the-command-line) and [Windows](install/windows-install.md#install-from-the-command-line), or alternatively by setting the values in the `install-settings.json` file.
- Docker Desktop now stops overriding .docker/config.json `credsStore` keys on application start. Note that if you use a custom credential helper then the CLI `docker login` and `docker logout` does not affect whether the UI is signed in to Docker or not. In general, it is better to sign into Docker via the UI since the UI supports multi-factor authentication.
- Added a warning about the [forthcoming removal of Compose V1 from Docker Desktop](../compose/migrate.md). Can be suppressed with `COMPOSE_V1_EOL_SILENT=1`.
- In the Compose config, boolean fields in YAML should be either `true` or `false`. Deprecated YAML 1.1 values such as “on” or “no” now produce a warning.
- Improved UI for image table, allowing rows to use more available space.
- Fixed various bugs in port-forwarding.
- Fixed a HTTP proxy bug where an HTTP request without a Server Name Indication record would be rejected with an error.

#### For Windows

- Reverted to fully patching etc/hosts on Windows (includes `host.docker.internal` and `gateway.docker.internal` again). For WSL, this behavior is controlled by a new setting in the **General** tab. Fixes [docker/for-win#13388](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/13388) and [docker/for-win#13398](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/13398).
- Fixed a spurious `courgette.log` file appearing on the Desktop when updating Docker Desktop. Fixes [docker/for-win#12468](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12468).
- Fixed the "zoom in" shortcut (ctrl+=). Fixes [docker/for-win#13392](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/13392).
- Fixed a bug where the tray menu would not correctly update after second container type switch. Fixes [docker/for-win#13379](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/13379).

#### For Mac

- Increased the performance of VM networking when using the Virtualization framework on macOS Ventura and above. Docker Desktop for Mac now uses gVisor instead of VPNKit. To continue using VPNKit, add `"networkType":"vpnkit"` to your `settings.json` file located at `~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.docker/settings.json`.
- Fixed a bug where an error window is displayed on uninstall.
- Fixed a bug where the setting `deprecatedCgroupv1` was ignored. Fixes [docker/for-mac#6801](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6801).
- Fixed cases where `docker pull` would return `EOF`.

#### For Linux

- Fixed a bug where the VM networking crashes after 24h. Fixes [docker/desktop-linux#131](https://github.com/docker/desktop-linux/issues/131).

### Security

#### For all platforms

### Known issues

#### For Windows

Installing Docker Desktop 4.5.0 from scratch has a bug which defaults Docker Desktop to use the Hyper-V backend instead of WSL 2. This means, Windows Home users will not be able to start Docker Desktop as WSL 2 is the only supported backend. To work around this issue, you must uninstall 4.5.0 from your machine and then download and install Docker Desktop 4.5.1 or a higher version. Alternatively, you can edit the Docker Desktop settings.json file located at `%APPDATA%\Docker\settings.json` and manually switch the value of the `wslEngineEnabled` field to `true`.

- [docker scan v0.16.0](https://github.com/docker/scan-cli-plugin/releases/tag/v0.16.0)

### Security

- Fixed [CVE-2021-45449](../security/index.md#cve-2021-45449) that affects users currently on Docker Desktop version 4.3.0 or 4.3.1.

Docker Desktop version 4.3.0 and 4.3.1 has a bug that may log sensitive information (access token or password) on the user's machine during login.
This only affects users if they are on Docker Desktop 4.3.0, 4.3.1 and the user has logged in while on 4.3.0, 4.3.1. Gaining access to this data would require having access to the user’s local files.

### Bug fixes and enhancements

#### For all platforms

- Docker Desktop displays an error if `registry.json` contains more than one organization in the `allowedOrgs` field. If you are using multiple organizations for different groups of developers, you must provision a separate `registry.json` file for each group.
- Fixed a regression in Compose that reverted the container name separator from `-` to `_`. Fixes [docker/compose-switch](https://github.com/docker/compose-switch/issues/24).

#### For Mac

- Fixed the memory statistics for containers in the Dashboard. Fixes [docker/for-mac/#4774](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6076).
- Added a deprecated option to `settings.json`: `"deprecatedCgroupv1": true`, which switches the Linux environment back to cgroups v1. If your software requires cgroups v1, you should update it to be compatible with cgroups v2. Although cgroups v1 should continue to work, it is likely that some future features will depend on cgroups v2. It is also possible that some Linux kernel bugs will only be fixed with cgroups v2.
- Fixed an issue where putting the machine to Sleep mode after pausing Docker Desktop results in Docker Desktop not being able to resume from pause after the machine comes out of Sleep mode. Fixes [for-mac#6058](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6058).

#### For Windows

- Doing a `Reset to factory defaults` no longer shuts down Docker Desktop.

### Known issues

#### For all platforms

- The tips of the week show on top of the mandatory login dialog when an organization restriction is enabled via a `registry.json` file.

#### For Windows

- Clicking **Proceed to Desktop** after logging in in the browser, sometimes does not bring the Dashboard to the front.
- After logging in, when the Dashboard receives focus, it sometimes stays in the foreground even when clicking a background window. As a workaround you need to click the Dashboard before clicking another application window.
- When the Dashboard is open, even if it does not have focus or is minimized, it will still catch keyboard shortcuts (e.g. ctrl-r for Restart)

## 4.3.2

### Bug fixes and minor changes

#### For all platforms

- Added a self-diagnose warning if the host lacks Internet connectivity.
- Fixed an issue which prevented users from saving files from a volume using the Save As option in the Volumes UI. Fixes [docker/for-win#12407](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12407).
- Docker Desktop now uses cgroupv2. If you need to run `systemd` in a container then:
  - Ensure your version of `systemd` supports cgroupv2. [It must be at least `systemd` 247](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/19760#issuecomment-851565075). Consider upgrading any `centos:7` images to `centos:8`.
  - Containers running `systemd` need the following options: [`--privileged --cgroupns=host -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:rw`](https://serverfault.com/questions/1053187/systemd-fails-to-run-in-a-docker-container-when-using-cgroupv2-cgroupns-priva).

#### For Mac

- Docker Desktop on Apple silicon no longer requires Rosetta 2, with the exception of [three optional command line tools](troubleshoot/known-issues.md).

#### For Windows

- Fixed an issue that caused Docker Desktop to fail during startup if the home directory path contains a character used in regular expressions. Fixes [docker/for-win#12374](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12374).

### Known issue

Docker Dashboard incorrectly displays the container memory usage as zero on
Hyper-V based machines.
You can use the [`docker stats`](../engine/reference/commandline/stats.md)
command on the command line as a workaround to view the
actual memory usage. See
[docker/for-mac#6076](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6076).

### Deprecation

- The following internal DNS names are deprecated and will be removed from a future release: `docker-for-desktop`, `docker-desktop`, `docker.for.mac.host.internal`, `docker.for.mac.localhost`, `docker.for.mac.gateway.internal`. You must now use `host.docker.internal`, `vm.docker.internal`, and `gateway.docker.internal`.
- Removed: Custom RBAC rules have been removed from Docker Desktop as it gives `cluster-admin` privileges to all Service Accounts. Fixes [docker/for-mac/#4774](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4774).

## 4.2.0

{{< release-date date="2021-11-09" >}}

### New

**Pause/Resume**: You can now pause your Docker Desktop session when you are not actively using it and save CPU resources on your machine.

- Ships [Docker Public Roadmap#226](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/226)

**Software Updates**: The option to turn off automatic check for updates is now available for users on all Docker subscriptions, including Docker Personal and Docker Pro. All update-related settings have been moved to the **Software Updates** section.

- Ships [Docker Public Roadmap#228](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/228)

**Window management**: The Docker Dashboard window size and position persists when you close and reopen Docker Desktop.

### Upgrades

- [Docker Engine v20.10.10](../engine/release-notes/20.10.md#201010)
- [containerd v1.4.11](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.4.11)
- [runc v1.0.2](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.2)
- [Go 1.17.2](https://golang.org/doc/go1.17)
- [Compose v2.1.1](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/v2.1.1)
- [docker-scan 0.9.0](https://github.com/docker/scan-cli-plugin/releases/tag/v0.9.0)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

#### For all platforms

- Improved: Self-diagnose now also checks for overlap between host IPs and `docker networks`.
- Fixed the position of the indicator that displays the availability of an update on the Docker Dashboard.

#### For Mac

- Fixed an issue that caused Docker Desktop to stop responding upon clicking **Exit** on the fatal error dialog.
- Fixed a rare startup failure affecting users having a `docker volume` bind-mounted on top of a directory from the host. If existing, this fix will also remove manually user added `DENY DELETE` ACL entries on the corresponding host directory.
- Fixed a bug where a `Docker.qcow2` file would be ignored on upgrade and a fresh `Docker.raw` used instead, resulting in containers and images disappearing. Note that if a system has both files (due to the previous bug) then the most recently modified file will be used, to avoid recent containers and images disappearing again. To force the use of the old `Docker.qcow2`, delete the newer `Docker.raw` file. Fixes [docker/for-mac#5998](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5998).
- Fixed a bug where subprocesses could fail unexpectedly during shutdown, triggering an unexpected fatal error popup. Fixes [docker/for-mac#5834](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5834).

#### For Windows

- Fixed Docker Desktop sometimes hanging when clicking Exit in the fatal error dialog.
- Fixed an issue that frequently displayed the **Download update** popup when an update has been downloaded but hasn't been applied yet [docker/for-win#12188](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12188).
- Fixed installing a new update killing the application before it has time to shut down.
- Fixed: Installation of Docker Desktop now works even with group policies preventing users to start prerequisite services (e.g. LanmanServer) [docker/for-win#12291](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12291).

## 4.1.1

{{< release-date date="2021-10-12" >}}

### Bug fixes and minor changes

#### For Mac

> When upgrading from 4.1.0, the Docker menu does not change to **Update and restart** so you can just wait for the download to complete (icon changes) and then select **Restart**. This bug is fixed in 4.1.1, for future upgrades.

- Fixed a bug where a `Docker.qcow2` file would be ignored on upgrade and a fresh `Docker.raw` used instead, resulting in containers and images disappearing. If a system has both files (due to the previous bug), then the most recently modified file will be used to avoid recent containers and images disappearing again. To force the use of the old `Docker.qcow2`, delete the newer `Docker.raw` file. Fixes [docker/for-mac#5998](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5998).
- Fixed the update notification overlay sometimes getting out of sync between the **Settings** button and the **Software update** button in the Docker Dashboard.
- Fixed the menu entry to install a newly downloaded Docker Desktop update. When an update is ready to install, the **Restart** option changes to **Update and restart**.

#### For Windows

- Fixed a regression in WSL 2 integrations for some distros (e.g. Arch or Alpine). Fixes [docker/for-win#12229](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12229)
- Fixed update notification overlay sometimes getting out of sync between the Settings button and the Software update button in the Dashboard.

## 4.1.0

### Bug fixes and minor changes

#### For Windows

- Fixed a bug related to anti-malware software triggering, self-diagnose avoids calling the `net.exe` utility.
- Fixed filesystem corruption in the WSL 2 Linux VM in self-diagnose. This can be caused by [microsoft/WSL#5895](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5895).
- Fixed `SeSecurityPrivilege` requirement issue. See [docker/for-win#12037](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12037).
- Fixed CLI context switch sync with UI. See [docker/for-win#11721](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/11721).
- Added the key `vpnKitMaxPortIdleTime` to `settings.json` to allow the idle network connection timeout to be disabled or extended.
- Fixed a crash on exit. See [docker/for-win#12128](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/12128).
- Fixed a bug where the CLI tools would not be available in WSL 2 distros.
- Fixed switching from Linux to Windows containers that was stuck because access rights on panic.log. See [for-win#11899](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/11899).

### Known Issues

### New

Docker has [announced](https://www.docker.com/blog/updating-product-subscriptions/) updates and extensions to the product subscriptions to increase productivity, collaboration, and added security for our developers and businesses.

The updated [Docker Subscription Service Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-subscription-service-agreement) includes a change to the terms for **Docker Desktop**.

- Docker Desktop **remains free** for small businesses (fewer than 250 employees AND less than $10 million in annual revenue), personal use, education, and non-commercial open source projects.
- It requires a paid subscription (**Pro, Team, or Business**), for as little as $5 a month, for professional use in larger enterprises.
- The effective date of these terms is August 31, 2021. There is a grace period until January 31, 2022 for those that will require a paid subscription to use Docker Desktop.
- The Docker Pro and Docker Team subscriptions now **include commercial use** of Docker Desktop.
- The existing Docker Free subscription has been renamed **Docker Personal**.
- **No changes** to Docker Engine or any other upstream **open source** Docker or Moby project.

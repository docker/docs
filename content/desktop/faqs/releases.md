### How frequent will new releases be?

New releases are available roughly every month, unless there are critical fixes that need to be released sooner. 

The **Automatically check for updates** setting in the **Software updates** tab is turned on by default. This means you receive notifications in the Docker menu and a notification badge on the Docker Dashboard when a new version is available. 

You can also let Docker Desktop to automatically download new updates in the background by selecting the **Always download updates** checkbox.

Sometimes new versions are rolled out gradually over a few days. Therefore, if you wait, it will turn up soon. Alternatively, you can select **Check for Updates** from the Docker menu to jump the queue and get the latest version immediately.

### How do I ensure that all users on my organization are using the same version?

This is managed through your IT administrator's endpoint management software.

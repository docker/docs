### How frequent will new releases be?

New releases are available roughly every month, unless there are critical fixes that need to be released sooner.

### How do I ensure that all users on my team are using the same version?

Previously you had to manage this yourself. Now, it happens automatically as a side effect of all users being on the latest version.

### My colleague has got a new version but I havenâ€™t got it yet

Sometimes we may roll out a new version gradually over a few days. Therefore, if you wait, it will turn up soon. Alternatively, you can select **Check for Updates** from the Docker menu to jump the queue and get the latest version immediately.

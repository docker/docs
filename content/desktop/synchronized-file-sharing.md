Synchronized file shares is an alternative file sharing mechanism that provides fast and flexible host-to-VM file sharing, enhancing bind mount performance through the use of synchronized filesystem caches.

## Who is it for?

Synchronized file shares is ideal for developers who: 
- Have large repositories or monorepos with 100 000 files or more totaling hundreds of megabytes or even gigabytes.
- Are using virtual filesystems, such as VirtioFS, gRPC FUSE, and osxfs, which are no longer scaling well with their codebases. 
- Regularly encounter performance limitations.
- Don't want to worry about file ownership or spend time resolving conflicting file-ownership information when modifying multiple containers.

## How does Synchronized file shares work?

A Synchronized file share behaves just like a virtual file share, but takes advantage of a high-performance, low-latency code synchronization engine to create a synchronized cache of the host files on an ext4 filesystem within the Docker Desktop VM. If you make filesystem changes on the host or in the VMâ€™s containers, it propagates via bidirectional synchronization.

After creating a file share instance, any container using a bind mount that points to a location on the host filesystem matching the specified synchronized file share location, or a subdirectory within it,  utilizes the Synchronized File Shares feature. Bind mounts that don't satisfy this condition are passed to the normal virtual filesystem [bind-mounting mechanism](../storage/bind-mounts.md), for example VirtioFS or gRPC-FUSE.

## Create a file share instance 

To create a file share instance:
1. Sign in to Docker Desktop.
2. In **Settings**, navigate to the **File sharing** tab within the **Resources** section. 
3. In the **Synchronized File Shares** section, select the **Create share** icon.
4. Select a host folder to share. The synchronized file share should initialize and be usable.

File shares take a few seconds to initialize as files are copied into the Docker Desktop VM. During this time, the status indicator displays **Preparing**. There is also a status icon in the footer of the Docker Dashboard that keeps you updated.

When the status indicator displays **Watching for filesystem changes**, your files are available to the VM through all the standard bind mount mechanisms, whether that's `-v` in the command line or specified in your `compose.yml` file.

>**Note**
>
> When you create a new service, setting the [bind mount option consistency](../engine/reference/commandline/service_create.md#options-for-bind-mounts) to `:consistent` bypasses Synchronized file shares.

## Explore your file share instance

The **Synchronized file shares** section displays all your file share instances and provides useful information about each instance including:
- The origin of the file share content
- A status update
- How much space each file share is using
- The number of filesystem entry counts
- The number of symbolic links
- Which container(s) is using the file share instance

Selecting a file share instance expands the dropdown and exposes this information.

## Use `.syncignore`

You can use a `.syncignore` file at the root of each file share, to exclude local files from your file share instance. It supports the same syntax as `.dockerignore` files and excludes, and/or re-includes, paths from synchronization. `.syncignore` files are ignored at any location other than the root of the file share.
 
Some example of things you might want to add to your `.syncignore` file are:
- Large dependency directories, for example `node_modules` and `composer` directories (unless you rely on accessing them via a bind mount)
- `.git` directories (again, unless you need them)

In general, use your `.syncignore` file to exclude items that aren't critical to your workflow, especially those that would be slow to sync or use significant storage.

## Known issues

- Changes made to `.syncignore` don't lead to immediate deletions unless the file share is recreated. In other words, files that are newly ignored due to modifications in the `.syncignore` file remain in their current location, but are no longer updated during synchronization.

- Case conflicts, due to Linux being case-sensitive and macOS/Windows only being case-preserving, display as **File exists** problems in the GUI. These can be ignored. However, if they persist, you can report the issue.

- File share instances mounted into [ECI](hardened-desktop/enhanced-container-isolation/_index.md) containers are currently read-only.

- You cannot remove a file share instance during the initial synchronization. You have to wait for it to complete before **Delete** has any effect.

- Synchronized file shares proactively reports temporary issues, which can result in occasional **Conflict** and **Problem** indicators appearing in the GUI during synchronization. These can be ignored. However, if they persist, you can report the issue.

- If you switch from WSL2 to Hyper-V on Windows, Docker Desktop needs to be fully restarted.

- POSIX-style Windows paths are not supported. Avoid setting the [`COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS`](../compose/environment-variables/envvars.md#compose_convert_windows_paths) environment variable in Docker Compose.

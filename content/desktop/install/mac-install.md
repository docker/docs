## System requirements

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab name="Mac with Intel chip" >}}

- A supported version of macOS.

  > **Important**
  >
  > Docker supports Docker Desktop on the most recent versions of macOS. That is, the current release of macOS and the previous two releases. As new major versions of macOS are made generally available, Docker stops supporting the oldest version and supports the newest version of macOS (in addition to the previous two releases).
  { .important }

- At least 4 GB of RAM.

Beginning with Docker Desktop 4.3.0, we have removed the hard requirement to install Rosetta 2. There are a few optional command line tools that still require Rosetta 2 when using Darwin/AMD64. See [Known issues](../troubleshoot/known-issues.md). However, to get the best experience, we recommend that you install Rosetta 2. To install Rosetta 2 manually from the command line, run the following command:

  ```console
  $ softwareupdate --install-rosetta
  ```

## Install and run Docker Desktop on Mac

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab name="Install interactively" >}}

1. Download the installer using the download buttons at the top of the page, or from the [release notes](../release-notes.md).

2. Double-click `Docker.dmg` to open the installer, then drag the Docker icon to the **Applications** folder.

3. Double-click `Docker.app` in the **Applications** folder to start Docker.

4. The Docker menu displays the Docker Subscription Service Agreement.

    Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points: 
    - Docker Desktop is free for small businesses (fewer than 250 employees AND less than $10 million in annual revenue), personal use, education, and non-commercial open source projects.
    - Otherwise, it requires a paid subscription for professional use.
    - Paid subscriptions are also required for government entities.
    - Docker Pro, Team, and Business subscriptions include commercial use of Docker Desktop.

5. Select **Accept** to continue. 

   Note that Docker Desktop won't run if you do not agree to the terms. You can choose to accept the terms at a later date by opening Docker Desktop.

   For more information, see [Docker Desktop Subscription Service Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-subscription-service-agreement). We recommend that you also read the [FAQs](https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq).
6. From the installation window, select either: 
   - **Use recommended settings (Requires password)**. This let's Docker Desktop automatically set the necessary configuration settings. 
   - **Use advanced settings**. You can then set the location of the Docker CLI tools either in the system or user directory, enable the default Docker socket, and enable privileged port mapping. See [Settings](../settings/mac.md#advanced), for more information and how to set the location of the Docker CLI tools.
7. Select **Finish**. If you have applied any of the above configurations that require a password in step 6, enter your password to confirm your choice.

{{< tab name="Install from the command line" >}}

After downloading `Docker.dmg` from either the download buttons at the top of the page or from the [release notes](../release-notes.md), run the following commands in a terminal to install Docker Desktop in the **Applications** folder:

```console
$ sudo hdiutil attach Docker.dmg
$ sudo /Volumes/Docker/Docker.app/Contents/MacOS/install
$ sudo hdiutil detach /Volumes/Docker
```

As macOS typically performs security checks the first time an application is used, the `install` command can take several minutes to run.

The `install` command accepts the following flags:
- `--accept-license`: Accepts the [Docker Subscription Service Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-subscription-service-agreement) now, rather than requiring it to be accepted when the application is first run.
- `--allowed-org=<org name>`: Requires the user to sign in and be part of the specified Docker Hub organization when running the application
- `--user=<username>`: Performs the privileged configurations once during installation. This removes the need for the user to grant root privileges on first run. For more information, see [Privileged helper permission requirements](../mac/permission-requirements.md#permission-requirements). To find the username, enter `ls /Users` in the CLI.
- `--admin-settings`: Automatically creates an `admin-settings.json` file which is used by administrators to control certain Docker Desktop settings on client machines within their organization. For more information, see [Settings Management](../hardened-desktop/settings-management/index.md).
  - It must be used together with the `--allowed-org=<org name>` flag. 
  - For example:
    `--allowed-org=<org name> --admin-settings='{"configurationFileVersion": 2, "enhancedContainerIsolation": {"value": true, "locked": false}}'`
- `--proxy-http-mode=<mode>`: Sets the HTTP Proxy mode. The two modes are `system` (default) or `manual`.
- `--override-proxy-http=<URL>`: Sets the URL of the HTTP proxy that must be used for outgoing HTTP requests. It requires `--proxy-http-mode` to be `manual`.
- `--override-proxy-https=<URL>`: Sets the URL of the HTTP proxy that must be used for outgoing HTTPS requests, requires `--proxy-http-mode` to be `manual`
- `--override-proxy-exclude=<hosts/domains>`: Bypasses proxy settings for the hosts and domains. It's a comma-separated list.

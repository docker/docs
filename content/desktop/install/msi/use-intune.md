Learn how to deploy Docker Desktop using Intune, Microsoft's cloud-based device management tool. 

1. Sign in to your Intune admin center.
2. Add a new app. Select **Apps**, then **Windows**, then **Add**.
3. For the app type, select **Windows app (Win32)**
4. Select the `intunewin` package. 
5. Complete any relevant details such as the description, publisher, or app version and then select **Next**. 
6. Optional: On the **Program** tab, you can update the **Install command** field to suit your needs. The field is pre-populated with `msiexec /i "DockerDesktop.msi" /qn`. See the [Common installation scenarios](install-and-configure.md) for examples on the changes you can make. 

   > **Tip**
   >
   > It's recommended you configure the Intune deployment to schedule a reboot of the machine on successful installs.
   >
   > This is because the Docker Desktop installer installs Windows features depending on your engine selection and also updates the membership of the `docker-users` local group.
   >
   > You may also want to set Intune to determine behaviour based on return codes and watch for a return code of `3010`.

7. Complete the rest of the tabs and then review and create the app.

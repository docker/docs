Extensions use image labels to provide additional information such as title, description, screenshots, and more.

This information is then displayed as an overview of the extension, so users can choose to install it

You can define [Image labels](../../../engine/reference/builder.md#label) in the extension's `Dockerfile`.

Here is the list of labels you need to specify when building your extension:

| Label                                       | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Preview the extension in the Marketplace

You can validate that the image labels render as you expect.

When you create and install your unpublished extension, you can preview the extension in the Marketplace **Managed** tab. You can see how the extension labels render in the list and in the details page of the extension.

> Preview extensions already listed in Marketplace
>
> When you install a local image of an extension already published in the Marketplace, for example with the tag `latest`, your local image is currently not detected as "unpublished".
>
> You can re-tag your image in order to have a different image name that's not listed as a published extension.
> Use `docker tag org/published-extension unpublished-extension` and then `docker extension install unpublished-extension`.

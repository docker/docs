Docker Desktop is a one-click-install application for your Mac, Linux, or Windows environment
that lets you to build, share, and run containerized applications and microservices. 

It provides a straightforward GUI (Graphical User Interface) that lets you manage your containers, applications, and images directly from your machine. Docker Desktop can be used either on its own or as a complementary tool to the CLI. 

Docker Desktop reduces the time spent on complex setups so you can focus on writing code. It takes care of port mappings, file system concerns, and other default settings, and is regularly updated with bug fixes and security updates.

Docker Desktop works with your choice of development tools and languages and
gives you access to a vast library of certified images and templates in
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). This allows development teams to extend
their environment to rapidly auto-build, continuously integrate, and collaborate
using a secure repository.

Learn how to configure and set up a private marketplace with a curated list of extensions for your Docker Desktop users.

It is designed specifically for organizations who don’t give developers root access to their machines.

Docker Extensions' private marketplace feature makes use of [Settings Management](../hardened-desktop/settings-management/_index.md) so admins have complete control over the private marketplace.

## Prerequisites

- [Download and install Docker Desktop 4.26.0 or later](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/).
- You must be an administrator for your organization.
- You have the ability to push the `extension-marketplace` folder and `admin-settings.json` file to the locations specified below through device management software such as [Jamf](https://www.jamf.com/).

## Step one: Initialize the private marketplace

1. Create a folder locally for the content that will be deployed to your developers’ machines:

   ```console
   $ mkdir my-marketplace
   $ cd my-marketplace
   ```

2. Initialize the configuration files for your marketplace:

   {{< tabs >}}
   {{< tab name="Mac" >}}

   ```console
   $ /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin/extension-admin init
   ```

   {{< /tab >}}
   {{< tab name="Windows" >}}

   ```console
   $ C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\bin\extension-admin init
   ```

   {{< /tab >}}
   {{< tab name="Linux" >}}

   ```console
   $ /opt/docker-desktop/extension-admin init
   ```

   {{< /tab >}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

This creates 2 files:

- `admin-settings.json`, which activates the private marketplace feature once it’s applied to Docker Desktop on your developers’ machines.
- `extensions.txt`, which determines which extensions to list in your private marketplace.

## Step two: Set the private marketplace behaviour

The generated `admin-settings.json` file includes various settings you can modify.

Each setting has a `value` that you can set, including a `locked` field that allows you to lock the setting and make it unchangeable by your developers.

- `extensionsEnabled` enables Docker Extensions
- `extensionsPrivateMarketplace` activates the private marketplace and ensures Docker Desktop connects to content defined and controlled by the administrator instead of the public Docker marketplace.
- `onlyMarketplaceExtensions` allows or blocks users from installing other extensions by using the command line. Teams developing new extensions must have this setting unlocked (`"locked": false`) to install and test extensions being developed
- `extensionsPrivateMarketplaceAdminContactURL` defines a contact link for users to request new extensions in the private marketplace. If `value` is empty then no link is shown to your developers on Docker Desktop, otherwise this can be either an HTTP link or a “mailto:” link. For example,

  ```json
  "extensionsPrivateMarketplaceAdminContactURL": {
    "locked": true,
    "value": "mailto:admin@acme.com"
  }
  ```

To find out more information about the `admin-settings.json` file, see [Settings Management](../hardened-desktop/settings-management/_index.md).

## Step three: List allowed extensions for the private marketplace

The generated `extensions.txt` file defines the list of extensions that is available in your private marketplace.

Each line in the file is an allowed extension and follows the format of `org/repo:tag`.

For example, if you want to permit the Disk Usage extension you would enter the following into your `extensions.txt` file:

```console
docker/disk-usage-extension:0.2.8
```

If no tag is provided, the latest tag available for the image is used. You can also comment out lines with `#` so the extension is ignored.

This list can include different types of extension images: 
 
- Extensions from the public marketplace or any public image stored in Docker Hub,
- Extension images stored in Docker Hub as private images. Users need to be signed in and have pull access to these images.
- Extension images stored in a private registry. Users need to be signed in and have pull access to these images.
 
> **Important**
> 
> Your developers can only install the version of the extension that you’ve listed.

## Step four: Generate the private marketplace

Once the list in `extensions.txt` is ready, you can generate the marketplace:

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab name="Mac" >}}

```console
$ /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin/extension-admin generate
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab name="Windows" >}}

```console
$ C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\bin\extension-admin generate
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab name="Linux" >}}

```console
$ /opt/docker-desktop/extension-admin generate
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

This creates an `extension-marketplace` directory and downloads the marketplace metadata for all the allowed extensions.

The marketplace content is generated from extension image info as image labels, which is the [same format as public extensions](../extensions-sdk/extensions/labels.md). It includes the extension title, description, screenshots, links, etc. 

## Step five: Test the private marketplace setup on your Docker Desktop installation

We recommend you try the private marketplace on your Docker Desktop installation.

1. Copy the relevant generated files to the location where Docker Desktop reads its configuration files.

   {{< tabs >}}
   {{< tab name="Mac" >}}

   ```console
   $ sudo /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin/extension-admin apply
   ```

   {{< /tab >}}
   {{< tab name="Windows (run as admin)" >}}

   ```console
   $ C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\bin\extension-admin apply
   ```

   {{< /tab >}}
   {{< tab name="Linux" >}}

   ```console
   $ sudo /opt/docker-desktop/extension-admin apply
   ```

   {{< /tab >}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

2. Quit and reopen Docker Desktop. 
3. Sign in with an Docker account.

When you select the **Extensions** tab, you should see the private marketplace listing only the extensions you have allowed in `extensions.txt`.

## Step six: Distribute the private marketplace to your developers’ machines

Once you’ve confirmed that the private marketplace configuration works, the final step is to distribute the files to the developers’ machines with the MDM software your organization uses. For example, [Jamf](https://www.jamf.com/).

Make sure your developers are signed in to Docker Desktop in order for the private marketplace configuration to take effect. As an administrator, you should [configure a registry.json to enforce Docker Desktop sign-in](../../security/for-admins/configure-sign-in.md).

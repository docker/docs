## What will you learn?

* Containerize and run a Bun application using Docker
* Set up a local environment to develop a Bun application using containers
* Configure a CI/CD pipeline for a containerized Bun application using GitHub Actions
* Deploy your containerized application locally to Kubernetes to test and debug your deployment

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of JavaScript is assumed.
- You must have familiarity with Docker concepts like containers, images, and Dockerfiles. If you are new to Docker, you can start with the [Docker basics](/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-a-container.md) guide.

After completing the Bun getting started modules, you should be able to containerize your own Bun application based on the examples and instructions provided in this guide.

Start by containerizing an existing Bun application.

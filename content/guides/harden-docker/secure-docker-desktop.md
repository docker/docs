description: Use Settings Management to control Docker Desktop settings and learn best practices for hardened environments.

In secure environments, Docker Desktop must be tightly controlled to prevent
unauthorized behavior, unvetted updates, and data leakage. This module shows
you how to enforce strict settings using `admin-settings.json` and the Admin
Console, based on centralized security policy.

For a full list of supported settings and values, see the
[Settings reference](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-admins/hardened-desktop/settings-management/settings-reference/).

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed on user machines
- Organization owner access to your Docker organization
- A way to distribute `admin-settings.json` file or manage settings via MDM

## Step one: Disable telemetry and crash reporting

To prevent unapproved outbound data from Docker Desktop:

```json
{
  "sendUsageStatistics": false,
  "sendErrorReports": false
}
```

Lock both settings to ensure users canâ€™t re-enable them. This prevents Docker
Desktop from sending anonymized usage data or crash logs to Docker servers.

## Step two: Disable update checks

Prevent Docker Desktop from checking for new versions:

```json
{
  "disableUpdates": true
}
```

You should distribute updates internally through a vetted package source. Lock
this setting to ensure consistent versions across your organization.

## Step three: Restrict Docker Desktop features

Set the following to prevent installation of unvetted code or execution of
risky commands:

```json
{
  "allowExtensions": false,
  "blockDockerLoad": true,
  "hideOnboarding": true,
  "exposeDockerAPIOnWindows": false
}
```

These settings disable extensions, block loading local image tarballs,
suppress UI prompts, and prevent unsafe remote access to the Docker daemon.

## Step four: Lock down file sharing and emulation

Limit which host paths can be mounted into containers, enforce safe drivers,
and restrict CPU architecture emulation:

```json

{
  "allowedFileSharingPaths": ["/Users/dev/projects", "/Volumes/code"],
  "shareFilesOnStart": true,
  "useVirtioFS": true,
  "useGrpcFUSE": false,
  "useRosetta": false
  }
```

Ensure all of the above are locked. This ensures users can only mount secure,
pre-approved directories.

## Step five: Enforce SBOM indexing with Docker Scout

Enable Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation for all images:

```json
{
  "enableSBOMIndexing": true,
  "enableBackgroundSBOMIndexing": true
  }
```

Lock both settings to support compliance and vulnerability management workflows.

## Step six: Enforce proxy configuration

Prevent users from overriding corporate proxy settings:

```json
{
  "proxySettings": {
    "mode": "manual",
    "httpProxy": "http://proxy.corp.example.com:3128",
    "httpsProxy": "http://proxy.corp.example.com:3128",
    "noProxy": "*.internal.example.com,localhost",
    "authenticationMethod": "kerberos"
	  },
  "allowUserToEditProxySettings": false
  }
```

Lock the entire proxy config to ensure consistent and auditable network routing.

## Step seven: Standardize the Linux VM and WSL settings

Enforce low-level Linux backend configuration:

```json
{
  "useWSL2Engine": true,
  "daemonConfigFile": {
    "log-driver": "json-file",
    "storage-driver": "overlay2"
  },
  "vpnKitCIDR": "10.255.0.0/24"
}
```

Lock all of these settings to prevent drift from your approved baseline.

## Step eight: Disable embedded Kubernetes

To prevent local Kubernetes environments from drifting from production
standards:

```json
{
  "allowKubernetes": false,
  "showKubernetesSystemContainers": false,
  "kubernetesImageRepository": "registry.corp.example.com/k8s"
}
```

Lock these settings to remove ambiguity around where clusters are running and
how they behave.

## Step nine: Enforce Enhanced Container Isolation (ECI)

ECI provides a hardened boundary around Docker containers, especially important
in untrusted environments.

```json
{
  "enableECI": true,
  "allowECIConfiguration": false,
  "eciAllowedImages": ["registry.corp.example.com/secure-build-runner:latest"],
  "eciAllowDerivedImages": false,
  "eciAllowedCommands": ["ps", "pull"]
}
```

Use ECI to restrict which containers can mount the Docker socket and exactly
what they can do with it.

## Best practices

- Lock all critical security settings to prevent end-user overrides.
- Distribute `admin-settings.json` centrally, ideally via MDM or login script.
- Use [desktop settings reporting](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-admins/hardened-desktop/settings-management/compliance-reporting/) to audit compliance.
- Enforce a single approved Desktop version across your org. See [disableUpdates](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-admins/hardened-desktop/settings-management/settings-reference/#disableupdates).
- Avoid optional features unless explicitly vetted for your use case.

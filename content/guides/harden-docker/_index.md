This guide is for teams deploying Docker in regulated, production, or
security-conscious environments. It helps administrators enforce security best
practices, apply organization-wide controls, and reduce the attack surface of
Docker environments.

## Who's this for?

- Organization administrators
- Security engineers
- IT teams responsible for enforcing organization-wide security policies

## What you’ll learn

This guide walks you through how to:

- Enforce secure authentication using SSO and domain verification
- Apply least-privilege access controls across your organization
- Lock down Docker Desktop using centralized settings and policy enforcement
- Monitor usage and integrate with compliance and security tooling
- Align your Docker implementation with enterprise security and compliance
requirements

## Before you start

To follow this guide, you’ll need:

- A Docker Business subscription
- Organization owner access to your Docker organization
- Access to your identity provider (IdP) if configuring SSO
- A list of domains to verify and manage
- Docker Desktop installed on user machines

If you’re new to Docker or managing organizations, start with the
[Admin setup guide](/guides/admin-set-up) first.

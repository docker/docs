Once it's installed, complete the setup process and you're all set to run a Docker container.

## Try it out

In this hands-on guide, you will see how to run a Docker container using Docker Desktop.

Follow the instructions to run a container using the CLI.


## Run your first container

Open your CLI terminal and start a container by running the `docker run` command:



```console
$ docker run -d -p 8080:80 docker/welcome-to-docker
```

## Access the frontend

For this container, the frontend is accessible on port `8080`. To open the website, visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Manage containers using Docker Desktop


1. Open Docker Desktop and select the **Containers** field on the left sidebar.
2. You can view information about your container including logs, and files, and even access the shell by selecting the **Exec** tab.

Docker Desktop simplifies container management for developers by streamlining the setup, configuration, and compatibility of applications across different environments, thereby addressing the pain points of environment inconsistencies and deployment challenges.

## What's next?

Now that you have Docker Desktop installed and ran your first container, it's time to start developing with containers.

The natural language processing (NLP) guides teach you how to build and run NLP
applications. NLP applications can interpret and generate human language, both
spoken and written. This is a natural language, as opposed to a formal or
artificial one. NLP is a part of artificial intelligence (AI) and has a long
history that goes back to the origins of linguistics.

The R language-specific guide teaches you how to containerize a R application using Docker. In this guide, you’ll learn how to:

* Containerize and run a R application
* Set up a local environment to develop a R application using containers
* Configure a CI/CD pipeline for a containerized R application using GitHub Actions
* Deploy your containerized R application locally to Kubernetes to test and debug your deployment

Start by containerizing an existing R application.

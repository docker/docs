The Ruby language-specific guide teaches you how to containerize a Ruby on Rails application using Docker. In this guide, you’ll learn how to:

- Containerize and run a Ruby on Rails application
- Set up a local environment to develop a Ruby on Rails application using containers
- Configure a CI/CD pipeline for a containerized Ruby on Rails application using GitHub Actions
- Deploy your containerized Ruby on Rails application locally to Kubernetes to test and debug your deployment

Start by containerizing an existing Ruby on Rails application.

## Step 3: Rename your image

Before you can publish your image, you need to rename it so that Docker Hub knows that the image is yours. In a terminal, run the following command to rename your image. Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your Docker ID.

{{< include "open-terminal.md" >}}

```console
$ docker tag docker/welcome-to-docker YOUR-USERNAME/welcome-to-docker
```

## Step 4: Push your image to Docker Hub

To push your image to Docker Hub:

1. In Docker Desktop, go to the **Images** tab
2. In the **Actions** column for your image, select the **Show image actions** icon.
3. Select **Push to Hub**.

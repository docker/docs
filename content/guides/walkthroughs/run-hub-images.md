You can share and store images in Docker Hub
([http://hub.docker.com](http://hub.docker.com)). Docker Hub has over 100,000
images created by developers that you can run locally. You can search for Docker
Hub images and run them directly from Docker Desktop.

{{< include "guides-get-docker.md" >}}

## Step 1: Search for the image

You can search for Docker Hub images on Docker Desktop. To search for the image used in this walkthrough:

1. Open Docker Desktop and select the search.
2. Specify `docker/welcome-to-docker` in the search.

> **Note**
>
> Many images hosted on Docker Hub have a description that highlights what
> settings must be set in order to run them. You can read the description for
> the image on Docker Hub by selecting the image name in the search or by
> searching for the image directly on
> [https://hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com).

## Step 3: Explore the container

That's it! The container is ready to use. Go to the **Containers** tab in Docker Desktop to view the container.

## What will you learn?

* Containerize and run a Deno application using Docker
* Set up a local environment to develop a Deno application using containers
* Use Docker Compose to run the application.
* Configure a CI/CD pipeline for a containerized Deno application using GitHub Actions
* Deploy your containerized application locally to Kubernetes to test and debug your deployment

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of JavaScript is assumed.
- You must have familiarity with Docker concepts like containers, images, and Dockerfiles. If you are new to Docker, you can start with the [Docker basics](/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-a-container.md) guide.

After completing the Deno getting started modules, you should be able to containerize your own Deno application based on the examples and instructions provided in this guide.

Start by containerizing an existing Deno application.

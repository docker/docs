## Prerequisites

- You have a [Git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads). The examples in this section use a command-line based Git client, but you can use any client.

## Overview

This section walks you through containerizing and running a C++ application, using Docker Compose.

## Get the sample application

We're using the same sample repository that you used in the previous sections of this guide. If you haven't already cloned the repository, clone it now:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/c-plus-plus-docker.git
```

You should now have the following contents in your `c-plus-plus-docker` (root)
directory.

```text
├── c-plus-plus-docker/
│ ├── compose.yml
│ ├── Dockerfile
│ ├── LICENSE
│ ├── ok_api.cpp
│ └── README.md

```

To learn more about the files in the repository, see the following:

- [Dockerfile](/reference/dockerfile.md)
- [.dockerignore](/reference/dockerfile.md#dockerignore-file)
- [compose.yml](/reference/compose-file/_index.md)

## Run the application

Inside the `c-plus-plus-docker` directory, run the following command in a
terminal.

```console
$ docker compose up --build
```

Open a browser and view the application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You will see a message `{"Status" : "OK"}` in the browser.

In the terminal, press `ctrl`+`c` to stop the application.

### Run the application in the background

You can run the application detached from the terminal by adding the `-d`
option. Inside the `c-plus-plus-docker` directory, run the following command
in a terminal.

```console
$ docker compose up --build -d
```

Open a browser and view the application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

In the terminal, run the following command to stop the application.

```console
$ docker compose down
```

For more information about Compose commands, see the [Compose CLI
reference](/reference/cli/docker/compose/_index.md).

## Summary

In this section, you learned how you can containerize and run your C++
application using Docker.

## Next steps

In the next section, you'll learn how you can develop your application using
containers.

---

## Prerequisites

Complete [Containerize React.js application](containerize.md).

---

## Overview

In this section, you'll learn how to set up both production and development environments for your containerized React.js application using Docker Compose. This setup allows you to serve a static production build via Nginx and to develop efficiently inside containers using a live-reloading dev server with Compose Watch.

You’ll learn how to:
- Configure separate containers for production and development
- Enable automatic file syncing using Compose Watch in development
- Debug and live-preview your changes in real-time without manual rebuilds

---

## Automatically update services (Development Mode)

Use Compose Watch to automatically sync source file changes into your containerized development environment. This provides a seamless, efficient development experience without needing to restart or rebuild containers manually.

## Step 1: Create a development Dockerfile

Create a file named `Dockerfile.dev` in your project root with the following content:

```dockerfile
# =========================================
# Stage 1: Develop the React.js Application
# =========================================
ARG NODE_VERSION=22.14.0-alpine

# Use a lightweight Node.js image for development
FROM node:${NODE_VERSION} AS dev

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package-related files first to leverage Docker's caching mechanism
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install project dependencies
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm npm install

# Copy the rest of the application source code into the container
COPY . .

# Expose the port used by the Vite development server
EXPOSE 5173

# Use a default command, can be overridden in Docker compose.yml file
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

This file sets up a lightweight development environment for your React app using the dev server.


### Step 2: Update your `compose.yaml` file

Open your `compose.yaml` file and define two services: one for production (`react-prod`) and one for development (`react-dev`).

Here’s an example configuration for a React.js application:

```yaml
services:
  react-prod:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: docker-reactjs-sample
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"

  react-dev:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    ports:
      - "5173:5173"
    develop:
      watch:
        - action: sync
          path: .
          target: /app

```
- The `react-prod` service builds and serves your static production app using Nginx.
- The `react-dev` service runs your React development server with live reload and hot module replacement.
- `watch` triggers file sync with Compose Watch.

> [!NOTE]
> For more details, see the official guide: [Use Compose Watch](/manuals/compose/how-tos/file-watch.md).

### Step 3: Update vite.config.ts to ensure it works properly inside Docker

To make Vite’s development server work reliably inside Docker, you need to update your vite.config.ts with the correct settings.

Open the `vite.config.ts` file in your project root and update it as follows:

```ts
/// <reference types="vitest" />

import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
  base: "/",
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    host: true,
    port: 5173,
    strictPort: true,
  },
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `server` options in `vite.config.ts` are essential for running Vite inside Docker:
> - `host: true` allows the dev server to be accessible from outside the container.
> - `port: 5173` sets a consistent development port (must match the one exposed in Docker).
> - `strictPort: true` ensures Vite fails clearly if the port is unavailable, rather than switching silently.
> 
> For full details, refer to the [Vite server configuration docs](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html).


After completing the previous steps, your project directory should now contain the following files:

```text
├── docker-reactjs-sample/
│ ├── Dockerfile
│ ├── Dockerfile.dev
│ ├── .dockerignore
│ ├── compose.yaml
│ ├── nginx.conf
│ └── README.Docker.md
```

### Step 4: Start Compose Watch

Run the following command from your project root to start your container in watch mode:

```console
$ docker compose watch react-dev
```

### Step 5: Test Compose Watch with React

To verify that Compose Watch is working correctly:

1. Open the `src/App.tsx` file in your text editor.

2. Locate the following line:

    ```html
    <h1>Vite + React</h1>
    ```

3. Change it to:

    ```html
    <h1>Hello from Docker Compose Watch</h1>
    ```

4. Save the file.

5. Open your browser at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

You should see the updated text appear instantly, without needing to rebuild the container manually. This confirms that file watching and automatic synchronization are working as expected.

## Summary

In this section, you set up a complete development and production workflow for your React.js application using Docker and Docker Compose.

Here's what you achieved:
- Created a `Dockerfile.dev` to streamline local development with hot reloading  
- Defined separate `react-dev` and `react-prod` services in your `compose.yaml` file  
- Enabled real-time file syncing using Compose Watch for a smoother development experience  
- Verified that live updates work seamlessly by modifying and previewing a component

With this setup, you're now equipped to build, run, and iterate on your React.js app entirely within containers—efficiently and consistently across environments.

## Prerequisites

Complete [Containerize a Python application](containerize.md).

## Overview

In this section, you'll learn how to set up a development environment for your containerized application. This includes:

- Adding a local database and persisting data
- Configuring Compose to automatically update your running Compose services as you edit and save your code

## Update the application

You'll update your application to connect to a PostgreSQL database. Continue
working in your `python-docker-example` directory.

Replace the contents of `app.py` with the following:

```python {title="app.py"}
from collections.abc import AsyncIterator, Sequence
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

from fastapi import FastAPI
from sqlmodel import Field, Session, SQLModel, create_engine, select

from config import settings


class Hero(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: int | None = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    name: str = Field(index=True)
    secret_name: str
    age: int | None = Field(default=None, index=True)


engine = create_engine(str(settings.SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI))


def create_db_and_tables() -> None:
    SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine)


@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(_app: FastAPI) -> AsyncIterator[None]:
    create_db_and_tables()
    yield


app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)


@app.get("/")
def hello() -> str:
    return "Hello, Docker!"


@app.post("/heroes/")
def create_hero(hero: Hero) -> Hero:
    with Session(engine) as session:
        session.add(hero)
        session.commit()
        session.refresh(hero)
        return hero


@app.get("/heroes/")
def read_heroes() -> Sequence[Hero]:
    with Session(engine) as session:
        heroes = session.exec(select(Hero)).all()
        return heroes
```

Create a new file named `config.py` with the following contents:

```python {title="config.py"}
import os
from typing import Any

from pydantic import (
    PostgresDsn,
    computed_field,
    field_validator,
    model_validator,
)
from pydantic_core import MultiHostUrl
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings


class Settings(BaseSettings):
    POSTGRES_SERVER: str
    POSTGRES_PORT: int = 5432
    POSTGRES_USER: str
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: str | None = None
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE: str | None = None
    POSTGRES_DB: str

    @model_validator(mode="before")
    @classmethod
    def check_postgres_password(cls, data: Any) -> Any:
        """Validate that either POSTGRES_PASSWORD or POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE is set."""
        if isinstance(data, dict):
            password_file: str | None = data.get("POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE")  # type: ignore
            password: str | None = data.get("POSTGRES_PASSWORD")  # type: ignore
            if password_file is None and password is None:
                raise ValueError(
                    "At least one of POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE and POSTGRES_PASSWORD must be set."
                )
        return data  # type: ignore

    @field_validator("POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE", mode="before")
    @classmethod
    def read_password_from_file(cls, v: str | None) -> str | None:
        if v is not None:
            file_path = v
            if os.path.exists(file_path):
                with open(file_path) as file:
                    return file.read().strip()
            raise ValueError(f"Password file {file_path} does not exist.")
        return v

    @computed_field
    @property
    def SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI(self) -> PostgresDsn:
        url = MultiHostUrl.build(
            scheme="postgresql+psycopg",
            username=self.POSTGRES_USER,
            password=self.POSTGRES_PASSWORD
            if self.POSTGRES_PASSWORD
            else self.POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE,
            host=self.POSTGRES_SERVER,
            port=self.POSTGRES_PORT,
            path=self.POSTGRES_DB,
        )
        return PostgresDsn(url)


settings = Settings()  # type: ignore
```

Replace the contents of `requirements.txt` with the following:

```text {title="requirements.txt"}
fastapi==0.115.12
sqlmodel==0.0.24
psycopg[binary]==3.2.9
pydantic-settings==2.9.1
uvicorn==0.34.3
```

## Update Docker assets

Replace the contents of `Dockerfile` with the following. This version adds
`COPY` and `CMD` to the builder stage so that Compose can target it directly
during development.

```dockerfile {collapse=true,title=Dockerfile}
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# Comments are provided throughout this file to help you get started.
# If you need more help, visit the Dockerfile reference guide at
# https://docs.docker.com/go/dockerfile-reference/

# This Dockerfile uses Docker Hardened Images (DHI) for enhanced security.
# For more information, see https://docs.docker.com/dhi/

# Use the dev image to build and install dependencies.
# The builder stage is also used directly in development (see compose.yaml).
FROM dhi.io/python:3.12-dev AS builder

WORKDIR /app

RUN python3 -m venv /venv
ENV PATH="/venv/bin:$PATH"

# Download dependencies as a separate step to take advantage of Docker's caching.
# Leverage a cache mount to /root/.cache/pip to speed up subsequent builds.
# Leverage a bind mount to requirements.txt to avoid having to copy them into
# into this layer.
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip \
    --mount=type=bind,source=requirements.txt,target=requirements.txt \
    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy the source code into the container.
COPY . .

# Expose the port that the application listens on.
EXPOSE 8000

# Run the application.
CMD ["/venv/bin/python3", "-m", "uvicorn", "app:app", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=8000"]


# Use the minimal runtime image for production. It runs as nonroot by default.
FROM dhi.io/python:3.12

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=builder /venv /venv
ENV PATH="/venv/bin:$PATH"

COPY --from=builder /app .

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["/venv/bin/python3", "-m", "uvicorn", "app:app", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=8000"]
```

Update `compose.yaml` to add `target: builder` so that Compose uses the dev
image during development.

```yaml {collapse=true,title=compose.yaml}
# Comments are provided throughout this file to help you get started.
# If you need more help, visit the Docker Compose reference guide at
# https://docs.docker.com/go/compose-spec-reference/

# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
services:
  server:
    build:
      context: .
      target: builder
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
```

## Add a local database and persist data

You can use containers to set up local services, like a database. In this
section, you'll update the `compose.yaml` file to define a database service
and a volume to persist data.

In the `python-docker-example` directory, open the `compose.yaml` file in an
IDE or text editor and update it with the following.

```yaml {hl_lines="8-40"}
services:
  server:
    build:
      context: .
      target: builder
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_SERVER=db
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_DB=example
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db-password
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    secrets:
      - db-password
  db:
    image: dhi.io/postgres:18
    restart: always
    user: postgres
    secrets:
      - db-password
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=example
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db-password
    expose:
      - 5432
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "pg_isready"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
volumes:
  db-data:
secrets:
  db-password:
    file: db/password.txt
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> To learn more about the instructions in the Compose file, see [Compose file
> reference](/reference/compose-file/).

Before you run the application using Compose, notice that this Compose file specifies a `password.txt` file to hold the database's password. You must create this file as it's not included in the source repository.

In the `python-docker-example` directory, create a new directory named `db` and inside that directory create a file named `password.txt` that contains the password for the database. Using your favorite IDE or text editor, add the following contents to the `password.txt` file.

```text
mysecretpassword
```

Save and close the `password.txt` file.

You should now have the following contents in your `python-docker-example`
directory.

```text
├── python-docker-example/
│ ├── db/
│ │ └── password.txt
│ ├── app.py
│ ├── config.py
│ ├── requirements.txt
│ ├── .dockerignore
│ ├── .gitignore
│ ├── compose.yaml
│ └── Dockerfile
```

Now, run the following `docker compose up` command to start your application.

```console
$ docker compose up --build
```

Now test your API endpoint. Open a new terminal then make a request to the server using the curl commands:

Let's create an object with a post method

```console
$ curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/heroes/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "my hero",
  "secret_name": "austing",
  "age": 12
}'
```

You should receive the following response:

```json
{
  "age": 12,
  "id": 1,
  "name": "my hero",
  "secret_name": "austing"
}
```

Let's make a get request with the next curl command:

```console
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8000/heroes/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

You should receive the same response as above because it's the only one object we have in database.

```json
{
  "age": 12,
  "id": 1,
  "name": "my hero",
  "secret_name": "austing"
}
```

Press `ctrl+c` in the terminal to stop your application.

## Automatically update services

Use Compose Watch to automatically update your running Compose services as you
edit and save your code. For more details about Compose Watch, see [Use Compose
Watch](/manuals/compose/how-tos/file-watch.md).

Open your `compose.yaml` file in an IDE or text editor and then add the Compose
Watch instructions. The following is the updated `compose.yaml` file.

```yaml {hl_lines="18-21"}
services:
  server:
    build:
      context: .
      target: builder
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_SERVER=db
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_DB=example
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db-password
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    secrets:
      - db-password
    develop:
      watch:
        - action: rebuild
          path: .
  db:
    image: dhi.io/postgres:18
    restart: always
    user: postgres
    secrets:
      - db-password
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=example
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db-password
    expose:
      - 5432
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "pg_isready"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
volumes:
  db-data:
secrets:
  db-password:
    file: db/password.txt
```

Run the following command to run your application with Compose Watch.

```console
$ docker compose watch
```

In a terminal, curl the application to get a response.

```console
$ curl http://localhost:8000
Hello, Docker!
```

Any changes to the application's source files on your local machine will now be immediately reflected in the running container.

Open `python-docker-example/app.py` in an IDE or text editor and update the `Hello, Docker!` string by adding a few more exclamation marks.

```diff
-    return 'Hello, Docker!'
+    return 'Hello, Docker!!!'
```

Save the changes to `app.py` and then wait a few seconds for the application to rebuild. Curl the application again and verify that the updated text appears.

```console
$ curl http://localhost:8000
Hello, Docker!!!
```

Press `ctrl+c` in the terminal to stop your application.

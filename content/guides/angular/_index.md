The Angular language-specific guide shows you how to containerize an Angular application using Docker, following best practices for creating efficient, production-ready containers.

[Angular](https://angular.dev/) is a robust and widely adopted framework for building dynamic, enterprise-grade web applications. However, managing dependencies, environments, and deployments can become complex as applications scale. Docker streamlines these challenges by offering a consistent, isolated environment for development and production.

## What will you learn?

In this guide, you will learn how to:

- Containerize and run an Angular application using Docker.
- Set up a local development environment for Angular inside a container.
- Run tests for your Angular application within a Docker container.
- Configure a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for your containerized app.
- Deploy the containerized Angular application to a local Kubernetes cluster for testing and debugging.

You'll start by containerizing an existing Angular application and work your way up to production-level deployments.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have a working knowledge of:

- Basic understanding of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).
- Familiarity with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) for managing dependencies and running scripts.
- Familiarity with [Angular](https://angular.io/) fundamentals.
- Understanding of core Docker concepts such as images, containers, and Dockerfiles. If you're new to Docker, start with the [Docker basics](/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-a-container.md) guide.

Once you've completed the Angular getting started modules, youâ€™ll be fully prepared to containerize your own Angular application using the detailed examples and best practices outlined in this guide.

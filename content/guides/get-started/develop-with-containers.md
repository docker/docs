Now that you have Docker Desktop, let's do some application development! Specifically, we're going to do the following:

1. Clone and start a development project
2. Make change to the backend and frontend
3. See the changes immediately

Enough talk... let's get to it!

VIDEO WILL GO HERE

## Start the project

1. To get started, either clone or [download the project as a ZIP file](https://github.com/docker/getting-started-todo-app/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/docker/getting-started-todo-app
    ```

2. Once you have the project, start the development environment using Docker Compose.


   {{< tabs group="cli-or-vs-code" persist=true >}}
   {{< tab name="CLI" >}}

   To start the project using the CLI, run the following command:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   You will see output that shows container images being pulled down, containers starting, and more. Don't worry if you don't understand it all at this point. But, within a moment or two, things should stabilize and finish.

   {{< /tab >}}
   {{< tab name="VS Code" >}}

   1. Open the project in VS Code.
   2. If you haven't installed the Docker extension for VS Code, get it by going [to this link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker).
   3. In the Explorer, right-click on the `compose.yaml` file and click on **Compose up**.

      You will see output that shows container images being pulled down, containers starting, and more. Don't worry if you don't understand it all at this point. But, within a moment or two, things should stabilize and finish. Feel free to close the terminal once it's done.

   {{< /tab >}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

3. Open your browser to [http://localhost](http://localhost) to see the application up and running! The app is a simple to-do application, so feel free to add an item or two, mark some as done, or even delete an item.

### What's in the environment?

Now that the environment is up and running, what's actually in it? At a high-level, there are several containers that each serve a specific need for the application:

- **React frontend** - a Node container that's running the React dev server, using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Node backend** - the backend provides an API that provides the ability to retrieve, create, and delete to-do items
- **MySQL database** - a database to store the list items
- **phpMyAdmin** - a web-based interface to interact with the database that is accessible at [http://db.localhost](http://db.localhost)
- **Traefik proxy** - [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/) is an application proxy that routes requests to the right service. It sends all requests for `localhost/api/*` to the backend, requests for `localhost/*` to the frontend, and then requests for `db.localhost` to phpMyAdmin. This provides the ability to access all applications using port 80 (instead of different ports for each service).

With this environment, you as the developer didn't need to install or configure any services, populate a database schema, configure database credentials, or anything. You only needed Docker Desktop! The rest just worked!


## Make changes to the app

With this environment up and running, let's make a simple change to the application and see how Docker helps provide a fast feedback loop.

### Change the greeting

The greeting at the top of the page is populated by an API call at `/api/greeting`. Currently, it always returns "Hello world!". Let's modify it to return one of three randomized messages (that you'll get to choose).

1. Open the `backend/src/routes/getGreeting.js` file. This file provides the handler for the API endpoint.

2. Modify the variable at the top to an array of greetings. Feel free to use the ones provided below or any customize it to your own liking!

    ```js {linenos=table,hl_lines=["1-5"],linenostart=1}
    const GREETINGS = [
        "Whalecome!",
        "All hands on deck!",
        "Charting the course ahead!",
    ];

    module.exports = async (req, res) => {
    ...
    ```

3. Now, update the endpoint to send a random greeting from this list by making the following change:

    ```js {linenos=table,hl_lines=[3],linenostart=7}
    module.exports = async (req, res) => {
        res.send({
            greeting: GREETINGS[ Math.floor( Math.random() * GREETINGS.length )],
        });
    };
    ```

4. If you haven't done so yet, save the file. If you refresh your browser, you should see a new greeting. If you keep refreshing, you should see all of the messages appear.

### Change the placeholder text

When you look at the app, you'll see the placeholder text is simply "New Item". Let's make that a little more descriptive and fun! We'll also make a few changes to the styling of the app too.

1. Open the `client/src/components/AddNewItemForm.jsx` file. This provides the component to add a new item to the to-do list.

2. Modify the `placeholder` attribute of the `Form.Control` element to whatever you'd like to display.

    ```js {linenos=table,hl_lines=[5],linenostart=33}
    <Form.Control
        value={newItem}
        onChange={(e) => setNewItem(e.target.value)}
        type="text"
        placeholder="What do you need to do?"
        aria-label="New item"
    />
    ```

3. Save the file and go back to your browser. You should see the change already hot-reloaded into your browser. If you don't like it, feel free to tweak it until it looks just right!

### Change the background color

Before we consider the application finalized, we need to make the colors better.

1. Open the `client/src/index.scss` file.

2. Adjust the `background-color` attribute to any color you'd like. The provided snippet is a soft blue to go along with Docker's nautical theme.

    If you're using an IDE, you can pick a color using the integrated color pickers. Otherwise, feel free to use an online [Color Picker](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp).

    ```css {linenos=table,hl_lines=2,linenostart=3}
    body {
        background-color: #E5F2FC;
        margin-top: 50px;
        font-family: 'Lato';
    }
    ```

    Each save should let you see the change immediately in the browser. Keep adjusting it until it's the perfect setup for you!

And with that, you're done! Congrats on updating your website! :tada:


## Recap

Before we move on, let's take a moment and reflect on what happened here. Within a few moments, you were able to:

- **Start a complete development project with _zero_ installation effort.** The containerized environment provided the development environment, ensuring you have everything you need. You didn't have to install Node, MySQL, or any of the other dependencies directly on your machine. All you needed was Docker Desktop and a code editor.

- **Make changes and see them immediately.** This was made possible because 1) the processes running in each container are watching and responding to file changes and 2) the files are shared with the containerized environment.

Docker Desktop enables all of this and so much more! Once you start thinking with containers, you can create almost any environment and easily share it with your team.


## Next steps

Now that the application has been updated, let's learn about packaging it as a container image and pushing it to a registry, specifically Docker Hub.

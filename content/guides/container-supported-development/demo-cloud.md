When developing apps, it's often easier to outsource aspects of the application to cloud services, such as Amazon S3. However, connecting to those services in local development introduces IAM policies, networking constraints, and provisioning complications. While these requirements are important in a production setting, they complicate development environments significantly. 

With container-supported development, you can run local instances of these services during development and testing, removing the need for complex setups. In this demo, you'll see how LocalStack makes it easy to develop and test applications entirely from the developer's workstation.

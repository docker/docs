Now that we have containerized the Golang application, now we will use Docker Compose to connect our services together. We will connect the Golang application, Prometheus, and Grafana services together to monitor the Golang application with Prometheus and Grafana.

## Creating a Docker Compose file

Create a new file named `compose.yml` in the root directory of your Golang application. The Docker Compose file contains instructions to run multiple services and connect them together.

Here is a Docker Compose file for a Golang application, Prometheus, and Grafana services. You will also find this file in the `go-prometheus-monitoring` directory.

```yaml
services:
  api:
    container_name: go-api
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: go-api:latest
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
    networks:
      - go-network
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 5
    develop:
      watch:
        - path: .
          action: rebuild
      
  prometheus:
    container_name: prometheus
    image: prom/prometheus:v2.55.0
    volumes:
      - ./Docker/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    ports:
      - 9090:9090
    networks:
      - go-network
  
  grafana:
    container_name: grafana
    image: grafana/grafana:11.3.0
    volumes:
      - ./Docker/grafana.yml:/etc/grafana/provisioning/datasources/datasource.yaml
      - grafana-data:/var/lib/grafana
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    networks:
      - go-network
    environment:
      - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=admin
      - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password

volumes:
  grafana-data:

networks:
  go-network:
    driver: bridge
```

## Understanding the Docker Compose file

The Docker Compose file consists of three services:

- **Golang application service**: This service builds the Golang application using the Dockerfile and runs it in a container. It exposes the application's port `8000` and connects to the `go-network` network. It also defines a health check to monitor the application's health. We have also used `healthcheck` to monitor the health of the application. The health check runs every 30 seconds and retries 5 times if the health check fails. The health check uses the `curl` command to check the `/health` endpoint of the application. Apart from the health check, we have also added a `develop` section to watch the changes in the application's source code and rebuild the application using the docker compose watch feature.

- **Prometheus service**: This service runs the Prometheus server in a container. It uses the official Prometheus image `prom/prometheus:v2.55.0`.  It exposes the Prometheus server on port `9090` and connects to the `go-network` network. We have also mounted the `prometheus.yml` file from the `Docker` directory which is present in the root directory of our project. The `prometheus.yml` file contains the Prometheus configuration to scrape the metrics from the Golang application. This is how we connect the Prometheus server to the Golang application.

    ```yaml
    global:
      scrape_interval: 10s
      evaluation_interval: 10s

    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: myapp
        static_configs:
          - targets: ["api:8000"]
    ```
    In the `prometheus.yml` file, we have defined a job named `myapp` to scrape the metrics from the Golang application. The `targets` field specifies the target to scrape the metrics from. In this case, the target is the Golang application running on port `8000`. The `api` is the service name of the Golang application in the Docker Compose file. The Prometheus server will scrape the metrics from the Golang application every 10 seconds.

- **Grafana service**: This service runs the Grafana server in a container. It uses the official Grafana image `grafana/grafana:11.3.0`. It exposes the Grafana server on port `3000` and connects to the `go-network` network. You have also mounted the `grafana.yml` file from the `Docker` directory which is present in the root directory of your project. The `grafana.yml` file contains the Grafana configuration to add the Prometheus data source. This is how you connect the Grafana server to the Prometheus server. In the environment variables, you have set the Grafana admin user and password, which will be used to log in to the Grafana dashboard.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: 1
    datasources:
    - name: Prometheus (Main)
      type: prometheus
      url: http://prometheus:9090
      isDefault: true
    ```
      
    In the `grafana.yml` file, we have defined a Prometheus data source named `Prometheus (Main)`. The `type` field specifies the type of the data source, which is `prometheus`. The `url` field specifies the URL of the Prometheus server to fetch the metrics from. In this case, the URL is `http://prometheus:9090`. The `prometheus` is the service name of the Prometheus server in the Docker Compose file. The `isDefault` field specifies whether the data source is the default data source in Grafana.

Apart from the services, the Docker Compose file also defines a volume named `grafana-data` to persist the Grafana data and a network named `go-network` to connect the services together. You have created a custom network `go-network` to connect the services together. The `driver: bridge` field specifies the network driver to use for the network.

## Building and running the services

Now that you have the Docker Compose file, you can build the services and run them together using Docker Compose.

To build and run the services, run the following command in the terminal:

```console
$ docker compose up
```

The `docker compose up` command builds the services defined in the Docker Compose file and runs them together. You will see the similar output in the terminal:

```console
 ✔ Network go-prometheus-monitoring_go-network  Created                                                           0.0s 
 ✔ Container grafana                            Created                                                           0.3s 
 ✔ Container go-api                             Created                                                           0.2s 
 ✔ Container prometheus                         Created                                                           0.3s

```

The services will start running, and you can access the Golang application at `http://localhost:8000`, Prometheus at `http://localhost:9090/health`, and Grafana at `http://localhost:3000`. You can also check the running containers using the `docker ps` command.

```console
$ docker ps
```

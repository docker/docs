## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure the following tools are installed and available on your system:

- You have installed the latest version of [Docker Desktop](/get-started/get-docker.md).
- You have a [git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads). The examples in this section use a command-line based git client, but you can use any client.

> **New to Docker?**  
> Start with the [Docker basics](/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-a-container.md) guide to get familiar with key concepts like images, containers, and Dockerfiles.

---

## Overview

This guide walks you through the complete process of containerizing a Node.js application with Docker. You’ll learn how to create a production-ready Docker image using best practices that enhance performance, security, scalability, and operational efficiency.

By the end of this guide, you will:

- Containerize a Node.js application using Docker.
- Create and optimize a Dockerfile tailored for Node.js environments.
- Use multi-stage builds to separate dependencies and reduce image size.
- Configure the container for secure, efficient runtime using a non-root user.
- Follow best practices for building secure, lightweight, and maintainable Docker images.

## Get the sample application

Clone the sample application to use with this guide. Open a terminal, change
directory to a directory that you want to work in, and run the following command
to clone the git repository:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/kristiyan-velkov/docker-nodejs-sample
```

## Generate a Dockerfile
Docker provides an interactive CLI tool called `docker init` that helps scaffold the necessary configuration files for containerizing your application. This includes generating a `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `compose.yaml`, and `README.Docker.md`.

To begin, navigate to the root of your project directory:

```console
$ cd docker-nodejs-sample
```

Then run the following command:

```console
$ docker init
```
You’ll see output similar to:

```text
Welcome to the Docker Init CLI!

This utility will walk you through creating the following files with sensible defaults for your project:
  - .dockerignore
  - Dockerfile
  - compose.yaml
  - README.Docker.md

Let's get started!
```

The CLI will prompt you with a few questions about your app setup.
For consistency, please use the same responses shown in the example below when prompted:
| Question                                                   | Answer          |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| What application platform does your project use?           | Node            |
| What version of Node do you want to use?                   | 22.14.0-alpine  |
| Which package manager do you want to use?                  | npm             |
| Do you want to run "npm run build" before starting server? | yes             |
| What directory is your build output to?                    | dist            |
| What command do you want to use to start the app?          | npm run dev     |
| What port does your server listen on?                      | 8080            |

After completion, your project directory will contain the following new files:

```text
├── docker-nodejs-sample/
│ ├── Dockerfile
│ ├── .dockerignore
│ ├── compose.yaml
│ └── README.Docker.md
```
---

## Build the Docker image

The default Dockerfile generated by `docker init` serves as a solid starting point for general Node.js applications. However, Node.js is a front-end library that compiles into static assets, so we need to tailor the Dockerfile to optimize for how React applications are built and served in a production environment.

### Step 1: Review the generated files

In this step, you’ll improve the Dockerfile and configuration files by following best practices:

- Use multi-stage builds to keep the final image clean and small  
- Improve performance and security by only including what’s needed  

These updates help ensure your app is easy to deploy, fast to load, and production-ready.

> [!NOTE]
> A `Dockerfile` is a plain text file that contains step-by-step instructions to build a Docker image. It automates packaging your application along with its dependencies and runtime environment.  
> For full details, see the [Dockerfile reference](/reference/dockerfile/).


### Step 2: Configure the Dockerfile file 

Copy and replace the contents of your existing `Dockerfile` with the configuration below:

```dockerfile
# ----------------------------------------
# Stage 1: Base Layer for Reuse
# Installs dependencies using npm ci
# ----------------------------------------
    ARG NODE_VERSION=22.14.0-alpine
    FROM node:${NODE_VERSION} AS base
    
    # Set working directory inside the container
    WORKDIR /app
    
    # Copy dependency definitions
    COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
    
    # Install exact dependencies (clean, deterministic install)
    RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm npm ci
    
    
    # ----------------------------------------
    # Stage 2: Development Environment
    # Includes devDependencies and nodemon
    # ----------------------------------------
    FROM base AS development
    
    ENV NODE_ENV=development
    
    # Install all deps including dev tools like nodemon and jest
    RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm npm install
    
    # Copy source code after deps to optimize caching
    COPY . .
    
    # Expose app and debugger ports
    EXPOSE 8080 9229
    
    # Start the app in development mode with inspector enabled
    CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
    
    
    # ----------------------------------------
    # Stage 3: Production Build
    # Installs only production dependencies
    # ----------------------------------------
    FROM base AS production
    
    ENV NODE_ENV=production
    
    # Install only production dependencies
    RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm npm ci --omit=dev
    
    # Copy entire source codebase
    COPY . .
    
    # Drop root privileges for security
    USER node
    
    # Expose application port
    EXPOSE 8080
    
   # Start the app in production mode with inspector enabled
   CMD ["npm", "run", "prod"]
    
    
    # ----------------------------------------
    # Stage 4: Testing Environment
    # Runs tests with devDependencies (e.g. jest)
    # ----------------------------------------
    FROM base AS test
    
    ENV NODE_ENV=test
    
    # Install dependencies including devDependencies (for testing)
    RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm npm ci --include=dev
    
    # Copy source files and tests
    COPY . .
    
    # Drop privileges for safer test execution
    USER node
    
    # Run tests
    CMD ["npm", "run", "test"]
    
```

### Step 3: Configure the .dockerignore file

The `.dockerignore` file tells Docker which files and folders to exclude when building the image.


> [!NOTE]
> This helps:
>
> 1.Reduce image size  
> 2.Speed up the build process  
> 3.Prevent sensitive or unnecessary files (like `.env`, `.git`, or `node_modules`) from being added to the final image.
> 
> To learn more, visit the [.dockerignore reference](/reference/dockerfile.md#dockerignore-file).

Copy and replace the contents of your existing `.dockerignore` with the configuration below:

```dockerignore
# =============================
# Dependency directories
# =============================
node_modules/
dist/
build/

# =============================
# Logs & debugging
# =============================
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*

```

### Step 4: Build the Node.js application image

With your custom configuration in place, you're now ready to build the Docker image for your Node.js application.

After completing the previous steps, your project directory should now contain the following files:

```text
├── docker-nodejs-sample/
│ ├── Dockerfile
│ ├── .dockerignore
│ ├── compose.yaml
│ ├── nginx.conf
│ └── README.Docker.md
```

Now that your Dockerfile is configured, you can build the Docker image for your Node.js application.

> [!NOTE]
> The `docker build` command packages your application into an image using the instructions in the Dockerfile. It includes all necessary files from the current directory (called the [build context](/build/concepts/context/#what-is-a-build-context)).

Run the following command from the root of your project:

```console
$ docker build --tag docker-nodejs-sample .
```

What this command does:
- Uses the Dockerfile in the current directory (.)
- Packages the application and its dependencies into a Docker image
- Tags the image as docker-nodejs-sample so you can reference it later


#### Step 6:  View local images

After building your Docker image, you can check which images are available on your local machine using either the Docker CLI or [Docker Desktop](/manuals/desktop/use-desktop/images.md). Since you're already working in the terminal, let's use the Docker CLI.

To list all locally available Docker images, run the following command:

```console
$ docker images
```

Example Output:

```shell
REPOSITORY               TAG              IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
docker-nodejs-sample     latest           423525528038   14 seconds ago   75.8MB
```

This output provides key details about your images:

- **Repository** – The name assigned to the image.
- **Tag** – A version label that helps identify different builds (e.g., latest).
- **Image ID** – A unique identifier for the image.
- **Created** – The timestamp indicating when the image was built.
- **Size** – The total disk space used by the image.

If the build was successful, you should see `docker-nodejs-sample` image listed. 

---

## Run the containerized application

In the previous step, you created a Dockerfile for your Node.js application and built a Docker image using the docker build command. Now it’s time to run that image in a container and verify that your application works as expected.


Inside the `docker-nodejs-sample` directory, run the following command in a
terminal.

```console
$ docker compose up --build
```

Open a browser and view the application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see a simple Node.js web application.

Press `ctrl+c` in the terminal to stop your application.

### Run the application in the background

You can run the application detached from the terminal by adding the `-d`
option. Inside the `docker-nodejs-sample` directory, run the following command
in a terminal.

```console
$ docker compose up --build -d
```

Open a browser and view the application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see a simple web application preview.


To confirm that the container is running, use `docker ps` command:

```console
$ docker ps
```

This will list all active containers along with their ports, names, and status. Look for a container exposing port 8080.

Example Output:

```shell
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                          COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS             PORTS                    NAMES
88bced6ade95   docker-nodejs-sample-server   "nginx -c /etc/nginx…"   About a minute ago  Up About a minute  0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   docker-nodejs-sample-server-1
```


To stop the application, run:

```console
$ docker compose down
```


> [!NOTE]
> For more information about Compose commands, see the [Compose CLI
> reference](/reference/cli/docker/compose/_index.md).

## Summary

In this guide, you learned how to containerize, build, and run a Node.js application using Docker. By following best practices, you created a secure, optimized, and production-ready setup.

What you accomplished:
- Initialized your project using `docker init` to scaffold essential Docker configuration files.
- Replaced the default `Dockerfile` with a multi-stage build that compiles the Node.js application and serves the static files using Nginx.
- Replaced the default `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files and keep the image clean and efficient.
- Built your Docker image using `docker build`.
- Ran the container using `docker compose up`, both in the foreground and in detached mode.
- Verified that the app was running by visiting [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
- Learned how to stop the containerized application using `docker compose down`.

You now have a fully containerized Node.js application, running in a Docker container, and ready for deployment across any environment with confidence and consistency.

The Vue.js language-specific guide shows you how to containerize an Vue.js application using Docker, following best practices for creating efficient, production-ready containers.

[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) Vue.js is a progressive and flexible framework for building modern, interactive web applications. Its simplicity and modularity make it ideal for projects of any size, from small prototypes to large-scale enterprise solutions. However, as applications grow, managing dependencies, configuring environments, and handling deployments can become increasingly intricate. Docker addresses these complexities by providing a consistent, containerized environment that simplifies development, testing, and production workflows.

## What will you learn?

In this guide, you will learn how to:

- Containerize and run an Vue.js application using Docker.
- Set up a local development environment for Vue.js inside a container.
- Run tests for your Vue.js application within a Docker container.
- Configure a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for your containerized app.
- Deploy the containerized Vue.js application to a local Kubernetes cluster for testing and debugging.

You'll start by containerizing an existing Vue.js application and work your way up to production-level deployments.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have a working knowledge of:

- Basic understanding of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).
- Familiarity with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) for managing dependencies and running scripts.
- Familiarity with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) fundamentals.
- Understanding of core Docker concepts such as images, containers, and Dockerfiles. If you're new to Docker, start with the [Docker basics](/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-a-container.md) guide.

Once you've completed the Vue.js getting started modules, you’ll be fully prepared to containerize your own Vue.js application using the detailed examples and best practices outlined in this guide.

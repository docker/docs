description: Learn how to run your vue.js tests in a container.

## Prerequisites

Complete all the previous sections of this guide, starting with [Containerize Vue.js application](containerize.md).

## Overview

Testing is a critical part of the development process. In this section, you'll learn how to:

- Run unit tests using Vitest inside a Docker container.
- Use Docker Compose to run tests in an isolated, reproducible environment.

You’ll use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) — a blazing fast test runner designed for Vite — together with [@vue/test-utils](https://test-utils.vuejs.org/) to write unit tests that validate your component logic, props, events, and reactive behavior.

This setup ensures your Vue.js components are tested in an environment that mirrors how users actually interact with your application.

---

## Run tests during development

`docker-vuejs-sample` application includes a sample test file at location:

```console
$ src/components/__tests__/HelloWorld.spec.ts
```

This test uses Vitest and Vue Test Utils to verify the behavior of the HelloWorld component.

---

### Step 1: Update compose.yaml

Add a new service named `vuejs-test` to your `compose.yaml` file. This service allows you to run your test suite in an isolated containerized environment.

```yaml {hl_lines="22-26",linenos=true}
services:
  vuejs-prod:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: docker-vuejs-sample
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"

  vuejs-dev:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    ports:
      - "5173:5173"
    develop:
      watch:
        - action: sync
          path: .
          target: /app
          
  vuejs-test:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    command: ["npm", "run", "test:unit"]
```

The vuejs-test service reuses the same `Dockerfile.dev` used for [development](develop.md) and overrides the default command to run tests with `npm run test`. This setup ensures a consistent test environment that matches your local development configuration.


After completing the previous steps, your project directory should contain the following files:

```text
├── docker-vuejs-sample/
│ ├── Dockerfile
│ ├── Dockerfile.dev
│ ├── .dockerignore
│ ├── compose.yaml
│ ├── nginx.conf
│ └── README.Docker.md
```

### Step 4: Run the tests

To execute your test suite inside the container, run the following command from your project root:

```console
$ docker compose run --rm vuejs-test
```

This command will:
- Start the `vuejs-test` service defined in your `compose.yaml` file.
- Execute the `npm run test` script using the same environment as development.
- Automatically remove the container after the tests complete [`docker compose run --rm`](/engine/reference/commandline/compose_run) command.

You should see output similar to the following:

```shell
Test Files: 1 passed (1)
Tests:      1 passed (1)
Start at:   16:50:55
Duration:   718ms
```

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about Compose commands, see the [Compose CLI
> reference](/reference/cli/docker/compose/_index.md).

## Summary

In this section, you learned how to run unit tests for your Vue.js application inside a Docker container using Vitest and Docker Compose.

What you accomplished:
- Created a `vuejs-test` service in `compose.yaml` to isolate test execution.
- Reused the development `Dockerfile.dev` to ensure consistency between dev and test environments.
- Ran tests inside the container using `docker compose run --rm vuejs-test`.
- Ensured reliable, repeatable testing across environments without depending on your local machine setup.

## Next steps

Next, you’ll learn how to set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automatically build and test your Vue.js application in a containerized environment. This ensures your code is validated on every push or pull request, maintaining consistency and reliability across your development workflow.

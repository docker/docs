## Prerequisites

Complete [Containerize Vue.js application](containerize.md).

---

## Overview

In this section, you'll set up both production and development environments for your Vue.js application using Docker Compose. This approach streamlines your workflow—delivering a lightweight, static site via Nginx in production, and providing a fast, live-reloading dev server with Compose Watch for efficient local development.

You’ll learn how to:
- Configure isolated environments: Set up separate containers optimized for production and development use cases.
- Live-reload in development: Use Compose Watch to automatically sync file changes, enabling real-time updates without manual intervention.
- Preview and debug with ease: Develop inside containers with a seamless preview and debug experience—no rebuilds required after every change.

---

## Automatically update services (Development Mode)

Leverage Compose Watch to enable real-time file synchronization between your local machine and the containerized Vue.js development environment. This powerful feature eliminates the need to manually rebuild or restart containers, providing a fast, seamless, and efficient development workflow.

With Compose Watch, your code updates are instantly reflected inside the container—perfect for rapid testing, debugging, and live previewing changes.

## Step 1: Create a development Dockerfile

Create a file named `Dockerfile.dev` in your project root with the following content:

```dockerfile
# =========================================
# Stage 1: Develop the Vue.js Application
# =========================================
ARG NODE_VERSION=22.14.0-alpine

# Use a lightweight Node.js image for development
FROM node:${NODE_VERSION} AS dev

# Set environment variable to indicate development mode
ENV NODE_ENV=development

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package-related files first to leverage Docker's caching mechanism
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install project dependencies
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm npm install

# Copy the rest of the application source code into the container
COPY . .

# Expose the port used by the Vite development server
EXPOSE 5173

# Use a default command, can be overridden in Docker compose.yml file
CMD [ "npm", "run", "dev", "--", "--host" ]
```

This file sets up a lightweight development environment for your Vue.js application using the dev server.

### Step 2: Update your `compose.yaml` file

Open your `compose.yaml` file and define two services: one for production (`vuejs-prod`) and one for development (`vuejs-dev`).

Here’s an example configuration for an Vue.js application:

```yaml
services:
  vuejs-prod:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: docker-vuejs-sample
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"

  vuejs-dev:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    ports:
      - "5173:5173"
    develop:
      watch:
        - action: sync
          path: .
          target: /app
```
- The `vuejs-prod` service builds and serves your static production app using Nginx.
- The `vuejs-dev` service runs your Vue.js development server with live reload and hot module replacement.
- `watch` triggers file sync with Compose Watch.

> [!NOTE]
> For more details, see the official guide: [Use Compose Watch](/manuals/compose/how-tos/file-watch.md).

After completing the previous steps, your project directory should now contain the following files:

```text
├── docker-vuejs-sample/
│ ├── Dockerfile
│ ├── Dockerfile.dev
│ ├── .dockerignore
│ ├── compose.yaml
│ ├── nginx.conf
│ └── README.Docker.md
```

### Step 4: Start Compose Watch

Run the following command from the project root to start the container in watch mode

```console
$ docker compose watch vuejs-dev
```

### Step 5: Test Compose Watch with Vue.js

To confirm that Compose Watch is functioning correctly:

1. Open the `src/App.vue` file in your text editor.

2. Locate the following line:

    ```html
    <HelloWorld msg="You did it!" />
    ```

3. Change it to:

    ```html
    <HelloWorld msg="Hello from Docker Compose Watch" />
    ```

4. Save the file.

5. Open your browser at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

You should see the updated text appear instantly, without needing to rebuild the container manually. This confirms that file watching and automatic synchronization are working as expected.

## Summary

In this section, you set up a complete development and production workflow for your Vue.js application using Docker and Docker Compose.

Here’s what you accomplished:
- Created a `Dockerfile.dev` to streamline local development with hot reloading  
- Defined separate `vuejs-dev` and `vuejs-prod` services in your `compose.yaml` file  
- Enabled real-time file syncing using Compose Watch for a smoother development experience  
- Verified that live updates work seamlessly by modifying and previewing a component

With this setup, you're now equipped to build, run, and iterate on your Vue.js app entirely within containers—efficiently and consistently across environments.

Docker and the broader community of Docker experts have put together many different ways to get further training and hands-on experience with Docker. Expand your understanding of Docker and Kubernetes with these additional free and paid resources.

## Docker Training

Expand your knowledge on all things Docker with [basic to advanced trainings from Docker experts](https://www.docker.com/resources/trainings/). 

You can find recorded content at your own convenience, or register for a live session to participate in Q&A.

## Hosted labs

These self-paced and hands-on workshops use a free, hosted environment ([Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)) that doesn't require any installation. Follow along and learn more about Kubernetes.

* [Kubernetes Workshop](https://training.play-with-kubernetes.com/kubernetes-workshop/)

\* Labs are free but require registration with a Docker ID.

## Self-guided tutorials

Created by experts in the Docker community, these free tutorials provide guided step-by-step workflows for working with the Docker platform.

Docker and the broader community of Docker experts have put together many different ways to get further training and hands-on experience with Docker. Expand your understanding of Docker and Kubernetes with these additional free and paid resources.

## Docker Training

Learn Docker and containerization fundamentals through self-paced, [hands-on training courses](/get-started/introduction) created by Docker experts.

## Books

If books are your preferred learning style, check out these written by the [Docker Captains](https://www.docker.com/community/captains). Docker Captain is a distinction that Docker awards to select members of the community that are both experts in their field and are committed to sharing their Docker knowledge with others.

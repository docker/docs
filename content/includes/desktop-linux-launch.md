To start Docker Desktop for Linux:

1. Navigate to the Docker Desktop application in your Gnome/KDE Desktop.

2. Select **Docker Desktop** to start Docker.

   The Docker Subscription Service Agreement displays.

3. Select **Accept** to continue. Docker Desktop starts after you accept the terms.

   Note that Docker Desktop won't run if you do not agree to the terms. You can choose to accept the terms at a later date by opening Docker Desktop.

   For more information, see [Docker Desktop Subscription Service Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-subscription-service-agreement). It is recommended that you also read the [FAQs](https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq).

Alternatively, open a terminal and run:

```console
$ systemctl --user start docker-desktop
```

When Docker Desktop starts, it creates a dedicated [context](/engine/context/working-with-contexts) that the Docker CLI
can use as a target and sets it as the current context in use. This is to avoid
a clash with a local Docker Engine that may be running on the Linux host and
using the default context. On shutdown, Docker Desktop resets the current
context to the previous one.

The Docker Desktop installer updates Docker Compose and the Docker CLI binaries
on the host. It installs Docker Compose V2 and gives users the choice to
link it as docker-compose from the Settings panel. Docker Desktop installs
the new Docker CLI binary that includes cloud-integration capabilities in `/usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli`
and creates a symlink to the classic Docker CLI at `/usr/local/bin`.

After youâ€™ve successfully installed Docker Desktop, you can check the versions
of these binaries by running the following commands:

```console
$ docker compose version
Docker Compose version v2.29.1

$ docker --version
Docker version 27.1.1, build 6312585

$ docker version
Client: 
 Version:           23.0.5
 API version:       1.42
 Go version:        go1.21.12
<...>
```

To enable Docker Desktop to start on sign in, from the Docker menu, select
**Settings** > **General** > **Start Docker Desktop when you sign in to your computer**.

Alternatively, open a terminal and run:

```console
$ systemctl --user enable docker-desktop
```

To stop Docker Desktop, select the Docker menu icon to open the Docker menu and select **Quit Docker Desktop**.

Alternatively, open a terminal and run:

```console
$ systemctl --user stop docker-desktop
```

Docker Compose provides a way for you to use secrets without having to use environment variables to store information. If youâ€™re injecting passwords and API keys as environment variables, you risk unintentional information exposure. Services can only access secrets when explicitly granted by a `secrets` attribute within the `services` top-level element.

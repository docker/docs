You can install Docker Engine in different ways, depending on your needs:

- Docker Engine comes bundled with
  [Docker Desktop for Linux](../../desktop/install/linux-install.md). This is
  the easiest and quickest way to get started.

- Set up and install Docker Engine from
  [Docker's Apt repository](#install-using-the-repository).

- [Install it manually](#install-from-a-package) and manage upgrades manually.

- Use a [convenience script](#install-using-the-convenience-script). Only
  recommended for testing and development environments.

During DockerCon 2017, Docker's docs team will be running our first-ever
hackathon, and you're invited to participate and win prizes -- whether you
attend DockerCon or are just watching the proceedings online.

Essentially, it's a bug-bash! We have a number of bugs filed against our docs
up on GitHub for you to grab.

You can participate in one of two ways:

- With the docs team's help in [**the fourth floor hack room at DockerCon on
  Tuesday, April 18th and Wednesday, April 19th, from 1-6pm**](https://dockercon.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=116676).
- Online! Right here! During the whole week of DockerCon (April 17th - 21st).

Or, both -- if you want to have the best shot. After all, we won't be in the
hack room 24/7 that whole week.

All participants who show up in the 4th floor hack room at DockerCon will get
[this way-cool magnet](http://www.cafepress.com/dockerdocshackathon.25633054) just for stopping by.

## How it works

We have a number of bugs that have built up in our docs queue on GitHub, and
we have labeled a whole slew of them with [the tag `hackathon`, which you can
see here](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/labels/hackathon).

Submit fixes for these bugs, or close them if you do a bit of research it turns
out they aren't actually valid. Every action you take gets you more points, and
the points are redeemable for dollars in [our hackathon store](http://www.cafepress.com/dockerdocshackathon). These points also
qualify you for valuable prizes like an Amazon gift card and a personally
engraved trophy!

## Prizes

- **All participants**: Points are redeemable for t-shirts, hoodies, sweatshirts,
  mugs, beer steins, pint glasses, flasks, hoodies, stickers, buttons, magnets,
  wall clocks, post-cards, and even doggie t-shirts.
- **3rd place**: A small trophy with a personal engraving, plus store credit
- **2nd place**: A small trophy with a personal engraving, plus store credit,
  plus a $150 Amazon Gift Card
- **1st place**: A large trophy with a personal engraving, plus store credit,
  plus a $300 Amazon Gift Card

### Bonuses

A select few will get bonuses for being extra special contributors:

- Largest single change introduced in a fix (files changed/lines of delta): 1000 points
- Most bugs closed (resolved as no-op or handled): 1000 points
- Most participation (attended all days): 1000 points

### Choosing a prize

You can see the point values for the bugs in the GitHub queue. Those are worth
cash in our rewards store at http://www.cafepress.com/dockerdocshackathon.

Our points-to-cash conversion rate will be figured out at the end of the
hackathon, and will essentially be a function of the number of points that
hackathon participants logged, and the number of dollars we have to spend on
prizes.

## When?

The docs hackathon is going on from **April 17th thru April 21st, 2017**. This
is the time when it's possible to claim and resolve bugs.

> **Note**: Okay, technically, we won't be tallying until the following Monday,
  April 24th. Just be sure you've submitted your claim form by then. If we don't
  see your work on Monday morning, it won't be counted.

## Where?

### In-person

Attending DockerCon? Come to **the fourth floor hack room on Tuesday and
Wednesday from 1pm to 6pm**. We'll be there to answer questions and help you.

> **Note**: While the hackathon is officially ongoing all week online, working in
  the hack room with us for these two days is
  by far the best way to participate; the docs team will be on-hand to get you
  started, get you unstuck, and guide you.

### Online

Drop into [the community Slack channel for the docs](https://dockercommunity.slack.com/messages/C2V58TASE) and ask any questions
you have. Otherwise, just go to GitHub and [look at our `hackathon` label](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/milestone/9)
and come here to claim your points when you're done.

## Claiming a bug

Whether attending in-person or online, to claim a bug as one that you are
working on (so nobody else grabs it out from under you) you must type a comment
saying you claim it. Respect it when you see other comments claiming a bug.

[View available bugs](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/milestone/9){: class="button primary-btn"}

## Claiming your points

Simply fill out this form when you're done participating. We'll take it from
there.

## Conversion rate

### Every 10 points is worth $1 USD in the swag store

You'll see point values for each of the bugs, such as `points/100` and `points/250`. Opening an accepted PR that 
fixes these bugs by the end of the hackathon earns you that number of points. 

So if you fix a 100-point bug, that's $10 you have to spend in [the swag store](http://www.cafepress.com/dockerdocshackathon).

## Questions?

Ask us anything at docs@docker.com or in [the #docs channel on Slack](https://dockercommunity.slack.com/messages/C2V58TASE).

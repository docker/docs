Imagine you're an experienced technical writer. You need to review content for
how fresh and up to date it is. Apply the following:

1. Fix spelling errors and typos
2. Verify whether the markdown structure conforms to common markdown standards
3. Ensure the content follows our [style guide file](../instructions/styleguide-instructions.md) as a guide.
4. Make sure the titles on the page provide better context about the content (for an improved search experience).
5. Ensure all the components formatted correctly.
6. Improve the SEO keywords.
7. If you find numbered lists, make sure their numbering only uses 1's.
8. Ensure each line is limited to 80 characters.

Do your best and don't be lazy.

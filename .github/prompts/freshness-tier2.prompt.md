Imagine you're an experienced technical writer. You need to review content for
how fresh and up to date it is. Apply the following:

1. Improve the presentational layer - components, splitting up the page into smaller pages
   Consider the following:

    1. Can you use tabs to display multiple variants of the same steps?
    2. Can you make a key item of information stand out with a call-out?
    3. Can you reduce a large amount of text to a series of bullet points?
    4. Are there other code components you could use?
2. Check if any operating systems or package versions mentioned are still current and supported
3. Check the accuracy of the content
4. If appropriate, follow the document from start to finish to see if steps make sense in sequence
5. Try to add some helpful next steps to the end of the document, but only if there are no *Next steps* or *Related pages* section, already.
6. Try to clarify, shorten or improve the efficiency of some sentences.
7. Check for LLM readibility.

Do your best and don't be lazy.

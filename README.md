# Docs @ Docker

<img src="images/docker-docs.png" alt="Welcome to Docker Documentation" style="max-width: 50%;">

Welcome to the Docker Documentation repository. This is the source for
[https://docs.docker.com/](https://docs.docker.com/).

Feel free to send us pull requests and file issues. Our docs are completely
open source and we deeply appreciate contributions from the Docker community!

## Provide feedback

Weâ€™d love to hear your feedback. Please file documentation issues only in the
docs GitHub repository. You can file a new issue to suggest improvements or if
you see any errors in the existing documentation.

Before submitting a new issue, check whether the issue has already been
reported. You can join the discussion using an emoji, or by adding a comment to
an existing issue. If possible, we recommend that you suggest a fix to the issue
by creating a pull request.

You can ask general questions and get community support through the [Docker
Community Slack](http://dockr.ly/slack). Personalized support is available
through the Docker Pro, Team, and Business subscriptions. See [Docker
Pricing](https://www.docker.com/pricing) for details.

If you have an idea for a new feature or behavior change in a specific aspect of
Docker, or have found a product bug, file that issue in the project's code
repository.

We've made it really easy for you to file new issues.

- Click **New issue** on the docs repository and fill in the details, or
- Click **Request docs changes** in the right column of every page on
  docs.docker.com and add the details.

> Try out Docker Cloud!
>
> We suggest using [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/) as the
most up-to-date way to run Docker on your cloud providers. To get started, see
[Docker Cloud docs home page](/docker-cloud/index.md), [Docker Cloud Settings
and Docker ID](/docker-cloud/dockerid.md) and [Swarms in Docker Cloud
(Beta)](/docker-cloud/cloud-swarm/index.md). If you are running Edge channel
Docker for Mac or Windows, you can access your Docker Cloud account from those
Docker desktop applications. See Docker Cloud (Edge feature) on
[Mac](/docker-for-mac/index.md#docker-cloud-edge-feature) or
[Windows](/docker-for-windows/index.md#docker-cloud-edge-feature).
>
> Docker Machine still works as described here, but Docker Cloud
supercedes Machine for this purpose.

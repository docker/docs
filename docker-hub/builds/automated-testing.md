Docker Hub can automatically test changes to your source code repositories
using containers. You can enable `Autotest` on [any Docker Hub repository](../repos.md)
to run tests on each pull request to the source code repository to create a
continuous integration testing service.

Enabling `Autotest` builds an image for testing purposes, but does **not**
automatically push the built image to the Docker repository. If you want to push
built images to your Docker Hub repository, enable [Automated Builds](index.md).

## Set up automated test files

To set up your automated tests, create a `docker-compose.test.yml` file which
defines a `sut` service that lists the tests to be run.
The `docker-compose.test.yml` file should be located in the same directory that
contains the Dockerfile used to build the image.

For example:

```yaml
services:
  sut:
    build: .
    command: run_tests.sh
```

The example above builds the repository, and runs the `run_tests.sh` file inside
a container using the built image.

You can define any number of linked services in this file. The only requirement
is that `sut` is defined. Its return code determines if tests passed or not.
Tests **pass** if the `sut` service returns `0`, and **fail** otherwise.

> **Note**
> 
> Only the `sut` service and all other services listed in
> [`depends_on`](../../compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2.md#depends_on) are
> started. If you have services that poll for changes in other services, be sure
> to include the polling services in the [`depends_on`](../../compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2.md#depends_on)
> list to make sure all of your services start.
> Also make sure to include a compose file version from 2.0 upward as `depends_on`
> was added in [version 2.0](../../compose/compose-file/compose-versioning.md#version-2)
> file format.

You can define more than one `docker-compose.test.yml` file if needed. Any file
that ends in `.test.yml` is used for testing, and the tests run sequentially.
You can also use [custom build hooks](advanced.md#override-build-test-or-push-commands)
to further customize your test behavior.

> **Note**: If you enable Automated builds, they also run any tests defined
in the `test.yml` files.

## Enable automated tests on a repository

To enable testing on a source code repository, you must first create an
associated build-repository in Docker Hub.  Your `Autotest` settings are
configured on the same page as [automated builds](index.md), however
you do not need to enable Autobuilds to use `Autotest`. Autobuild is enabled per
branch or tag, and you do not need to enable it at all.

Only branches that are configured to use **Autobuild** push images to the
Docker repository, regardless of the Autotest settings.

1. Log in to Docker Hub and select **Repositories** in the top navigation.

3. Select the repository you want to enable `Autotest` on.

4. From the repository view, click the **Builds** tab.

4. Click **Configure automated builds**.

5. Configure the automated build settings as explained in [Automated Builds](index.md).

    At minimum you must configure:

    * The source code repository
    * the build location
    * at least one build rule

8. Choose your **Autotest** option.

    The following options are available:

    * `Off`: No additional test builds. Tests only run if they're configured
    as part of an automated build.

    * `Internal pull requests`: Run a test build for any pull requests
    to branches that match a build rule, but only when the pull request comes
    from the same source repository.

    * `Internal and external pull requests`: Run a test build for any
    pull requests to branches that match a build rule, including when the
    pull request originated in an external source repository.

    > **Note**: For security purposes, autotest on _external pull requests_ is
    limited on public repositories. Private images are not pulled and
    environment variables defined in Docker Hub are not
    available. Automated builds continue to work as usual.

9. Click **Save** to save the settings, or click **Save and build** to save and
run an initial test.

## Check your test results

From the repository's details page, click **Timeline**.

From this tab you can see any pending, in-progress, successful, and failed
builds and test runs for the repository.

You can click any timeline entry to view the logs for each test run.

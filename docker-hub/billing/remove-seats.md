You can manage your Docker Hub subscription anytime by removing seats from your plan. If you remove seats in the middle of the billing cycle, changes are applied immediately and reflect in the next billing cycle.

For example, if you receive your billing on the 8th of every month for 10 seats and you want to remove 2 seats on the 15th of the month, the 2 seats are removed immediately. Your payment for 8 seats begins the next month. If you are on the annual plan, the 2 seats are removed immediately, and your payment for the 8 seats begins next year.

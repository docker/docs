You can upgrade to a Pro or a Team plan from a Free plan, or from your current legacy plan. When you upgrade to a Pro or a Team plan, you will be able to immediately use all the features and entitlements offered in your new plan. For detailed information on features available in each plan, see [Docker Hub Pricing](https://hub.docker.com/pricing){: target="_blank" class="_"}.

>**Note:**
>
> - If you are on a legacy per-repository plan, you cannot upgrade to another legacy plan. You can only upgrade your legacy plan to the new Pro or Team plan.
>
> - Once you’ve upgraded your current legacy plan to a Pro or a Team plan, it is not possible to switch back to the legacy per-repository plan.

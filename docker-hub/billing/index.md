On May 14, 2020, Docker announced a new, per-seat pricing model that aligns with Docker’s [product strategy](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-strategy-helping-devs-build-and-ship-faster/){: target="_blank" class="_"} to accelerate developer workflows for cloud-native development. The previous private repository/parallel autobuild-based plans have been replaced with new **Pro** and **Team** plans that include unlimited private repositories.

Existing Docker customers subscribed to a paid plan before May 14, 2020 must upgrade to the new Pro or Team plan by January 31, 2021. Starting with May 14, 2020, new customers who sign up for Docker can choose between the new Free, Pro, and Team plans.

## Pricing plans

Docker offers pricing plans that are tailored for individual developers and development teams. You can also choose between an **Annual** or a **Monthly** subscription. The Pro and Team plans offered through annual subscription include a discount compared to the price of the same plan offered through monthly subscription.

**For individuals:**

The **Pro** plan includes unlimited public repositories, unlimited private repositories, unlimited collaborators, and 2 parallel builds starting at $5 per month with the annual subscription.

The **Free** plan includes unlimited public repositories and unlimited collaborators for public repositories at no cost per month.

**For development teams:**

The **Team** plan includes unlimited public and unlimited private repositories starting at $25 per month for the first 5 users and $7 per month for each user thereafter with the annual subscription. In addition, the Team plan offers 3 parallel builds, advanced collaboration and management tools, including organization and team management with role-based access controls for the whole team.

The **Free Team** plan includes unlimited public repositories at no cost per month. This plan also offers advanced collaboration and management tools, including organization and team management with role-based access controls which are limited to 1 team and 3 team members.

For detailed information about the features available in each plan, see [Docker Hub Pricing](https://hub.docker.com/pricing){: target="_blank" class="_"}.

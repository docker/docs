## Hub publisher profile

### What is the difference between a Community User and a Verified Publisher?

Community users are users who have signed up to receive a Docker ID and made some of their repositories public on Docker Hub. By contrast, Verified Publishers have engaged directly with Docker's partner team, and enrolled in our Docker Technology Partner program. Verified Publisher profiles indicate that the business entity of the publisher has been validated, and have taken proactive steps to partner with Docker. Unlike community content, Verified Publisher profiles indicate true provenance of the content.

## Certified content

### What are Certified Containers and Plugins, and how are they differentiated from other content on Docker Hub?

The Docker Certification program is
designed for enterprise customers to recognize
high-quality content which is compatible, tested, and supported on Docker Enterprise by a Verified publisher. Docker Certification is aligned to the available
Docker Enterprise products, and gives enterprises a trusted way to run more
technology in containers with the confidence knowing there is a collaborative support relationship in place between Docker and the Verified Publisher.

## End-user experience

### Why do I see the pull command for a few products and no pull command in other products?

If a publisher publishes multiple images as part of their plan - we do not
display the pull command. The pull command visual is exclusively for submissions
that have a single image.

### Where can I see all my subscribed content?

To view your accessible content, go to the account menu at the upper right corner, and
click **My Content**. The page that appears lists all your active
subscriptions, and any lapsed or canceled subscriptions.

### Can I subscribe to content for my organization?

Yes! Members of an Organization's **Owners** team can subscribe to content
for use in their Organization. Once the subscription has been completed, images are available for any
organization member to pull.

Organization owners can view the organization's subscriptions by changing the
selected account on the **My Content** page.

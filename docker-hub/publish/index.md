The Verified Publisher Program provides several benefits and features to Docker
Hub publishers, such as:

- Verified publisher badge
- Insights and analytics
- Advanced image management
- Vulnerability scanning
- No rate limiting

## Verified publisher badge

The verified publisher badge signals high quality, and trust, to developers.
Images with this badge are verified to be of high quality, and that the content
can be trusted.

## Insights and analytic

The [insights and analytics](/docker-hub/publish/insights-analytics){:
target="blank" rel="noopener" class=""} service provides usage metrics for how
the community uses your Docker images, and grants you insight into your user's
behavior.

Select the time span for which you want to view analytics data, and export the
data in either a summary or raw format. The summary format shows you image pulls
per tag, and the raw format lists information about every image pull for the
selected time span. Data points include tag, type of pull, user geolocation,
client tool (user agent), and more.

## Advanced image management

[Advanced image management](/docker-hub/image-management/){: target="blank"
rel="noopener" class=""} is a tool that lets publishers browse and manage their
Docker Hub inventory. List, filter, and delete image tags in your repositories,
using the dashboard or API.

## Vulnerability scanning

Automatic vulnerability scanning using Snyk for images published to Docker Hub.
Scanning images ensures that the published content is secure, and underlines to
developers that it can be trusted. Scanning can be enabled on a per-repository
basis, refer to [vulnerability scanning](/docker-hub/vulnerability-scanning/){:
target="blank" rel="noopener" class=""} for more information about how to use
it.

## No rate limiting

For regular Docker images, image downloads are
[rate limited](/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/){: target="blank" rel="noopener"
class=""}. Images by verified publishers, however, are exempted from rate
limiting; users can pull these images an unlimited number of times.

## Who's eligible to become a verified publisher?

Any independent software vendor who distributes software on Docker Hub can join
the Verified Publisher Program and enjoy the benefits. Find out more by heading

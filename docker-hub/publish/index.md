The Verified Publisher Program provides several features and benefits to Docker
Hub publishers. The following perks are granted based on participation tier:

- Insights and analytics
- Vulnerability scanning
- Additional Docker Business seats

## Verified publisher badge

The verified publisher badge signals high quality, and trust, to developers.
Images with this badge are verified as high quality, and the content can be
trusted.

## Insights and analytic

The [insights and analytics](/docker-hub/publish/insights-analytics){:
target="blank" rel="noopener" class=""} service provides usage metrics for how
the community uses your Docker images, and grants you insight into your user's
behavior.

Select the time span you want to view analytics data, and export the data in
either a summary or raw format. The summary format shows you image pulls per
tag, and the raw format lists information about every image pull for the
selected time span. Data points include tag, type of pull, user geolocation,
client tool (user agent), and more.

## Vulnerability scanning

Automatic vulnerability scanning using Snyk for images published to Docker Hub.
Scanning images ensures that the published content is secure, and underlines to
developers that it can be trusted. Scanning can be enabled on a per-repository
basis, refer to [vulnerability scanning](/docker-hub/vulnerability-scanning/){:

it.

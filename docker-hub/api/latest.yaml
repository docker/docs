    Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container
    images with your team.

    It is the world's largest library and community for container images.

    In addition to the [Docker Hub UI](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/) and [Docker Hub CLI tool](https://github.com/docker/hub-tool#readme) (currently experimental),

    Docker provides an API that allows you to interact with Docker Hub.

    Browse through the Docker Hub API documentation to explore the supported endpoints.

      The following resources are available to interact with the documented API:

      - <a href="https://github.com/docker/hub-tool#readme" target="_blank">Docker Hub CLI tool</a> (currently experimental)
      - <a href="https://www.postman.com/dockerdev/workspace/docker-hub/collection/17990590-9574e087-2a50-4ecf-88b3-55f12a29d99e" target="_blank">Postman Collection</a>
  - name: rate-limiting
    x-displayName: Rate Limiting
    description: |
      The Docker Hub API is limited on the amount of requests you can perform per minute against it.

      If you haven't hit the limit, each request to the API will return the

      following headers in the response.

      - `X-RateLimit-Limit` - The limit of requests per minute.
      - `X-RateLimit-Remaining` - The remaining amount of calls within the limit period.
      - `X-RateLimit-Reset` - The unix timestamp of when the remaining resets.

      If you have hit the limit, you will receive a response status of `429` and the `X-Retry-After` 
      header in the response.

      The `X-Retry-After` header is a unix timestamp of when you can call the API again.

      *Note: These rate limits are separate from anti-abuse and Docker Hub

      download, or pull rate limiting. To learn more about Docker Hub pull rate

      limiting, see [Docker Hub download rate limit](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/).*
  - name: authentication
    x-displayName: Authentication
    description: |
      Most Docker Hub API endpoints require you to authenticate using your
      Docker credentials before using them.

      Additionally, similar to the Docker Hub UI features, API endpoint responses may vary depending 
      on your plan (Free, Pro, or Team) and your account's permissions.

      To learn more about the features available in each plan and to upgrade your existing plan, see [Docker Pricing](https://www.docker.com/pricing).
  - name: access-tokens
    x-displayName: Personal Access Tokens
    description: |
      The Personal Access Token endpoints lets you manage personal access tokens. For more 
      information, see [Access Tokens](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/).

      You can use a personal access token instead of a password in the [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/) 
      or in the [Create an authentication token](#operation/PostUsersLogin) route to obtain a bearer 
      token.

      ### Scopes

      For each scope grouping (in this case "repo"), you only need to define 1 scope as any lower 
      scopes are assumed. For example: If you define `repo:write`, the API assumes the scope of both 
      `repo:read` *and* `repo:public_read` as well. If you were to define both `repo:write` *and* 
      `repo:read`, then `repo:read` is assumed by `repo:write` and ignored.

      ***Treat your personal access token like your password and keep it secret. You cannot retrieve 
      your token after it is generated.***
  - name: images
    x-displayName: Advanced Image Management

      The Advanced Image Management API endpoints allow you to manage Docker
      images across all repositories.

  - name: audit-logs
    x-displayName: Audit Logs
    description: |
      The Audit Logs API endpoints allow you to query audit log events across a
      namespace.

        authenticate with Docker Hub APIs.

        The returned token is used in the HTTP Authorization header like `Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}`.

        Most Docker Hub APIs require this token either to consume or to get detailed information. For example, to list images in a private repository.

        Deleting a currently tagged image deletes the tag from the repository.

        List users, returns paginated users for an organization. Use `startIndex`

        **Sorting:**<br>
        Sorting lets you to specify the order of returned resources by specifying
        a combination of `sortBy` and `sortOrder` query parameters.

        The `sortBy` parameter specifies the attribute whose value will be used
        to order the returned responses. The `sortOrder` parameter defines the
        order in which the `sortBy` parameter is applied. Allowed values are
        "ascending" and "descending".

        **Filtering:**<br>
        You can request a subset of resources by specifying the `filter` query
        parameter containing a filter expression. Attribute names and attribute
        operators used in filters are case insensitive. The filter parameter
        must contain at least one valid expression. Each expression must contain
        an attribute name followed by an attribute operator and an optional
        value.

        Supported operators are listed below.

        - `eq` equal
        - `ne` not equal
        - `co` contains
        - `sw` starts with
        - `and` Logical "and"
        - `or` Logical "or"
        - `not` "Not" function
        - `()` Precedence grouping

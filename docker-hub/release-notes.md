### New

You can now purchase or upgrade to a Docker Business subscription using a credit card. To learn more, see [Upgrade your subscription](../subscription/upgrade.md).

## 2021-08-31

### New

Docker has [announced](https://www.docker.com/blog/updating-product-subscriptions/){: target="*blank" rel="noopener" class="*" id="dkr_docs_relnotes_btl"} updates and extensions to the product subscriptions to increase productivity, collaboration, and added security for our developers and businesses. Docker subscription tiers now include Personal, Pro, Team, and Business.

The updated [Docker Subscription Service Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-subscription-service-agreement) includes a change to the terms for **Docker Desktop**.

- Docker Desktop **remains free** for small businesses (fewer than 250 employees AND less than $10 million in annual revenue), personal use, education, and non-commercial open source projects.
- It requires a paid subscription (**Pro, Team, or Business**), for as little as $5 a month, for professional use in larger enterprises.
- The effective date of these terms is August 31, 2021. There is a grace period until January 31, 2022 for those that will require a paid subscription to use Docker Desktop.
- The Docker Pro and Docker Team subscriptions now **include commercial use** of Docker Desktop.
- The existing Docker Free subscription has been renamed **Docker Personal**.
- **No changes** to Docker Engine or any other upstream **open source** Docker or Moby project.

    To understand how these changes affect you, read the [FAQs](https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq){: target="*blank" rel="noopener" class="*" id="dkr_docs_relnotes_btl"}. For more information, see [Docker subscription overview](../subscription/index.md).

### Enhancement

When managing the content of your repositories, you can now filter the results based on the currentness of the tags and more easily identify your untagged images.
For more information, see  [Advanced Management Dashboard](image-management.md).

For Docker Hub API documentation, see [Docker Hub API Reference](api/latest.md#operation/GetNamespacesRepositoriesImages).

## 2021-04-13

### Enhancement

The **Billing Details** page now shows any organizations you own, in addition to your personal account. This allows you to clearly identify the billing details of your chosen namespace, and enables you to switch between your personal and your organization accounts to view or update the details.

## 2021-04-09

### Enhancement

You can now specify any email address to receive billing-related emails for your organization. The email address doesn't have to be associated with an organization owner account. You must be an owner of the organization to update any billing details.

To change the email address receiving billing-related emails, log into Docker Hub and navigate to the **Billing** tab of your organization. Select **Payment Methods** > **Contact Information**. Enter the new email address that you'd like to use in the **Email** field. Click **Update** for the changes to take effect.

For details on how to update your billing information, see [Update billing information](../subscription/upgrade.md#update-billing-information).

## 2020-05-14

### New features

* Docker has announced a new, per-seat pricing model to accelerate developer workflows for cloud-native development. The previous private repository/concurrent autobuild-based plans have been replaced with new **Pro** and **Team** plans that include unlimited private repositories. For more information, see [Docker subscription](../subscription/index.md).

* Docker has enabled download rate limits for downloads and pull requests on Docker Hub. This caps the number of objects that users can download within a specified timeframe. For more information, see [Download rate limit](download-rate-limit.md).

## 2019-11-04

### Enhancements

* The [repositories page](repos.md) and all
related settings and tabs have been updated and moved from `cloud.docker.com`
to `hub.docker.com`. You can access the page at its new URL: [https://hub.docker.com/repositories](https://hub.docker.com/repositories).

### Known Issues

* Scan results don't appear for some official images.

## 2019-10-21

### New features
* **Beta:** Docker Hub now supports [two-factor authentication (2FA)](2fa/index.md). Enable it in your account settings, under the **[Security](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security)** section.

    > If you lose both your 2FA authentication device and recovery code, you may
    > not be able to recover your account.
    {: .important }

### Enhancements

* Scan results don't appear for some official images.


## 2019-10-02

### Enhancements
* You can now manage teams and members straight from your [organization page](https://hub.docker.com/orgs).

  * **New:** Members - manage your members directly from this page (delete,
  add, or open their teams)
  * **New:** Teams - search by team or username, and open up any team page to
  manage the team
  * **New:** Invitees (conditional tab, only if an invite exists) - resend or
  remove invitiations from this tab
  * Repositories
  * Settings
  * Billing

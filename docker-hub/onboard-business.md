The following section contains step-by-step instructions on how to get started onboarding your organization after you obtain a Docker Business subscription.

## Prerequisites

Before you start to on board your organization, ensure that you've completed the following:
- You have a Docker Business subscription. [Get in touch with us](https://www.docker.com/pricing/contact-sales/) if you haven't subscribed to Docker Business yet.
- Your Docker Business subscription is new. If you upgraded your Docker Team subscription or renewed your Docker Business subscription, see [what's next](#whats-next).
- Your Docker Business subscription has started. You cannot complete all the steps until after your subscription start date.
-  You are familiar with Docker terminology. If you discover any unfamiliar terms, see the [glossary](/glossary/#docker) or [FAQs](../docker-hub/onboarding-faqs.md).

## Step 1: Identify your Docker users and their Docker accounts

To begin, you should identify which users you will need to add to your Docker Business organization. Identifying your users will help you efficiently allocate your subscription's seats and manage access.

1. Identify the Docker users in your organization.
   - If your organization uses device management software, like MDM or JAMF, you may use the device management software to help identify Docker users. See your device management software's documentation for details. You can identify Docker users by checking if Docker Desktop is installed at the following location on each user's machine:
      - Mac: `/Applications/Docker.app`
      - Windows: `C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker`
   - If your organization does not use device management software, you may survey your users.
2. Instruct all your Docker users in your organization to update their existing Docker account's email address to an address that's in your organization's domain, or to create a new account using an email address in your organization's domain.
   - To update an account's email address, instruct your users to sign in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}, go to [Account Settings](https://hub.docker.com/settings/general){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}, and update the email address to their email address in your organization's domain.
   - To create a new account, instruct your users to go [sign up](https://hub.docker.com/signup){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"} using their email address in your organization's domain.
3. Ask your Docker sales representative to provide a list of Docker accounts that use an email address in your organization's domain.

## Step 2: Add your Docker Business subscription to an organization

On the day that your Docker Business subscription starts, your organization's primary contact will receive a welcome email from Docker to guide you through creating a new organization or to let you choose an existing organization for your Docker Business subscription.

> **Note**
>
> If your organization's primary contact does not receive a welcome email from Docker on the day that your subscription starts:
>   - Check your email spam folder.
>   - Use the steps below to verify that your Docker Business organization does not already exist.
>   - Contact your Docker sales representative to verify your primary contact's email address.

After completing the steps from the welcome email, verify that your organization exists and your organization has a Docker Business subscription:

1. Go to [Billing Details](https://hub.docker.com/billing){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"} and then select on your organization's name.
2. Under **Plan**, view your subscription. If you organization has a Docker Business subscription, you will see **Docker Business**.

## Step 3: Add members

Now that you have a Docker Business organization, it's time to start adding members. Add members to your organization by using one of the following methods:

   * **Single Sign-on**: Automatically provision and add members when they sign in to Docker through your identity provider. For details, see [Configure Single Sign-on](../single-sign-on/index.md){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}.
   * **System for Cross-domain Identity Management**: Automatically provision, add, and de-provision members from your identity provider. For details, see [System for Cross-domain Identity Management](../docker-hub/scim.md/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}.
   * **Invite members**: Invite members using their Docker ID or email address. For details, see [Invite members](../docker-hub/members.md/#invite-members){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}.
      > **Note**
      >
      > Before you invite members, you must create at least one team. For details, see [Create a team](../docker-hub/orgs.md/#create-a-team){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}.


## Step 4: Enforce sign-in for Docker Desktop

By default, members of your organization can use Docker Desktop on their machines without signing in to any Docker account. To ensure that a user signs in to a Docker account that is a member of your organization and that the
organization’s settings apply to the user’s session, you can use a `registry.json` file. For details, see [Configure registry.json to enforce sign-in](../docker-hub/configure-sign-in.md){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}.

## What's next

Get the most out of your Docker Business subscription by leveraging these popular features:

- If you haven't configured [System for Cross-domain Identity Management](../docker-hub/scim.md/) yet, configure it now for centralized account management.
- Create [repositories](../docker-hub/repos/index.md) to share container images.
- Create [teams](../docker-hub/orgs.md/#create-a-team) and configure [repository permissions](../docker-hub/orgs.md/#configure-repository-permissions).
- Control which images your members can access with [Image Access Management](../docker-hub/image-access-management.md/).
- Control which registries your members can access with [Registry Access Management](../docker-hub/registry-access-management.md/).

Your Docker Business subscription provides many more additional features. [Learn more](../subscription/index.md).

keywords: build, security, engine, secret, BuildKit

Docker Build is one of the most used features of the Docker Engine - users
ranging from developers, build teams, and release teams all use Docker Build. 

Docker Build enhancements for 18.09 release introduces a much-needed overhaul of
the build architecture. By integrating BuildKit, users should see an improvement
on performance, storage management, feature functionality, and security.

* Docker images created with BuildKit can be pushed to Docker Hub just like
  Docker images created with legacy build
* the Dockerfile format that works on legacy build will also work with BuildKit
  builds
* The new `--secret` command line option allows the user to pass secret
  information for building new images with a specified Dockerfile 

For more information on build options, see the reference guide on the
[command line build options](../../engine/reference/commandline/build.md) and
the [Dockerfile reference](/engine/reference/builder/) page.


## Requirements

* A current version of Docker (18.09 or higher)
* Network connection required for downloading images of custom frontends 

## Limitations

* Only supported for building Linux containers

## To enable BuildKit builds

Easiest way from a fresh install of docker is to set the `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`
environment variable when invoking the `docker build` command, such as:

```console
$ DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build .
```

To enable docker BuildKit by default, set daemon configuration in
`/etc/docker/daemon.json` feature to true and restart the daemon:

```json
{ "features": { "buildkit": true } }
```

## New Docker Build command line build output

New docker build BuildKit TTY output (default):

## Overriding default frontends

The new syntax features in `Dockerfile` are available if you override the default
frontend. To override the default frontend, set the first line of the
`Dockerfile` as a comment with a specific frontend image:

```dockerfile
# syntax=<frontend image>, e.g. # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.2
```

The examples on this page use features that are available in `docker/dockerfile`
version 1.2.0 and up. We recommend using `docker/dockerfile:1`, which always
points to the latest release of the version 1 syntax. BuildKit automatically
checks for updates of the syntax before building, making sure you are using the
most current version. Learn more about the `syntax` directive in the
[Dockerfile reference](/engine/reference/builder/#syntax).

## New Docker Build secret information

The new `--secret` flag for docker build allows the user to pass secret
information to be used in the Dockerfile for building docker images in a safe
way that will not end up stored in the final image.

`id` is the identifier to pass into the `docker build --secret`. This identifier
is  associated with the `RUN --mount` identifier to use in the Dockerfile. Docker
does not use the filename of where the secret is kept outside of the Dockerfile,
since this may be sensitive information.

`dst` renames the secret file to a specific file in the Dockerfile `RUN` command
to use.

For example, with a secret piece of information stored in a text file:

```console
$ echo 'WARMACHINEROX' > mysecret.txt
```

And with a Dockerfile that specifies use of a BuildKit frontend
`docker/dockerfile:1.2`, the secret can be accessed when performing a `RUN`:

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.2

FROM alpine

# shows secret from default secret location:
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=mysecret cat /run/secrets/mysecret

# shows secret from custom secret location:
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=mysecret,dst=/foobar cat /foobar
```

The secret needs to be passed to the build using the `--secret` flag.
This Dockerfile is only to demonstrate that the secret can be accessed. As you
can see the secret printed in the build output. The final image built will not
have the secret file:

```console
$ docker build --no-cache --progress=plain --secret id=mysecret,src=mysecret.txt .
...
#8 [2/3] RUN --mount=type=secret,id=mysecret cat /run/secrets/mysecret
#8       digest: sha256:5d8cbaeb66183993700828632bfbde246cae8feded11aad40e524f54ce7438d6

## Using SSH to access private data in builds

> **Acknowledgment**
>
> Please see [Build secrets and SSH forwarding in Docker 18.09](https://medium.com/@tonistiigi/build-secrets-and-ssh-forwarding-in-docker-18-09-ae8161d066)
> for more information and examples.

Some commands in a `Dockerfile` may need specific SSH authentication - for example, to clone a private repository.
Rather than copying private keys into the image, which runs the risk of exposing them publicly, `docker build` provides a way to use the host system's ssh access while building the image.

There are three steps to this process.

First, run `ssh-add` to add private key identities to the authentication agent.
If you have more than one SSH key and your default `id_rsa` is not the one you use for accessing the resources in question, you'll need to add that key by path: `ssh-add ~/.ssh/<some other key>`.
(For more information on SSH agent, see the [OpenSSH man page](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent).)

Second, when running `docker build`, use the `--ssh` option to pass in an existing SSH agent connection socket.
For example, `--ssh default=$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, or the shorter equivalent, `--ssh default`.

Third, to make use of that SSH access in a `RUN` command in the `Dockerfile`, define a mount with type `ssh`.
This will set the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable for that command to the value provided by the host to `docker build`, which will cause any programs in the `RUN` command which rely on SSH to automatically use that socket.
Only the commands in the `Dockerfile` that have explicitly requested SSH access by defining `type=ssh` mount will have access to SSH agent connections.
The other commands will have no knowledge of any SSH agent being available.

Here is an example `Dockerfile` using SSH in the container:

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM alpine

# Install ssh client and git
RUN apk add --no-cache openssh-client git

# Download public key for github.com
RUN mkdir -p -m 0700 ~/.ssh && ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

# Clone private repository
RUN --mount=type=ssh git clone git@github.com:myorg/myproject.git myproject
```

The image could be built as follows:

```console
$ docker build --ssh default .
```

As with `--mount=type=secret`, you can specify an `id` if you want to use multiple sockets per build and want to differentiate them.
For example, you could run `docker build --ssh main=$SSH_AUTH_SOCK --ssh other=$OTHER_SSH_AUTH_SOCK`.
In your `Dockerfile`, you could then have a `RUN --mount=type=ssh,id=main` and a `RUN --mount=type=ssh,id=other` to use those two sockets.
If a `--mount=type=ssh` doesn't specify an `id`, `default` is assumed.

## Troubleshooting : issues with private registries

#### x509: certificate signed by unknown authority

If you are fetching images from insecure registry (with self-signed certificates)
and/or using such a registry as a mirror, you are facing a known issue in
Docker 18.09 :

```console
[+] Building 0.4s (3/3) FINISHED
 => [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile
 => => transferring dockerfile: 169B
 => [internal] load .dockerignore
 => => transferring context: 2B
 => ERROR resolve image config for docker.io/docker/dockerfile:experimental
------
 > resolve image config for docker.io/docker/dockerfile:experimental:
------
failed to do request: Head https://repo.mycompany.com/v2/docker/dockerfile/manifests/experimental: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```

Solution: secure your registry properly. You can get SSL certificates from
Let's Encrypt for free. See [Deploy a registry server](../../registry/deploying.md).


#### image not found when the private registry is running on Sonatype Nexus version < 3.15

If you are running a private registry using Sonatype Nexus version < 3.15, and
receive an error similar to the following :

```console
------
 > [internal] load metadata for docker.io/library/maven:3.5.3-alpine:
------
------
 > [1/4] FROM docker.io/library/maven:3.5.3-alpine:
------
rpc error: code = Unknown desc = docker.io/library/maven:3.5.3-alpine not found
```

you may be facing the bug below : [NEXUS-12684](https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/NEXUS-12684)

Solution is to upgrade your Nexus to version 3.15 or above.

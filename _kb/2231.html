 User and organization data for Docker EE is stored in a
 <a class="link-https" href="https://www.rethinkdb.com/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">
  RethinkDB

 database which is replicated across all manager nodes in the UCP cluster.
</p>
<p>
 UCP constantly monitors the health of the replicas and alerts when one or more of the replicas are unhealthy.

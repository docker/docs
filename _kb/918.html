  Question
 </h2>
 <p>
  I recently created a new account in Docker Hub. When I try to click the verification link in the account activation email sent by Docker, it did not work, and threw a "502 Bad Gateway" error instead. What do I do now?

  It is likely that the confirmation link has expired. Docker Hub account confirmation links normally expire within 24 hours of sign-up. Using the email address that you entered to sign-up you can re-trigger a the confirmation email through Docker Hub's password reset page:
  <span>
  </span>
  <a href="https://hub.docker.com/reset-password/" rel="noreferrer">
   https://hub.docker.com/reset-password/
  </a>
  <span>
   .
  </span>
 </p>

  If you are still unable to verify your account and login to Docker Hub, please

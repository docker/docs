<p>
 Once a Docker ID has been created, it can not be used to create a new account, even if the account has been deactivated.
</p>
<p>
 If you need to change your email address and you have access to your account, you can change your email address in the account settings.
</p>
<p>
 If you mistyped your email address or used the wrong email during Docker Hub or Docker Cloud registration, and you can not access your account, open a
 <a href="https://success.docker.com/Support" rel="internal" title="Account Support Form">
  Customer Service Request
 </a>
 and include your username and the mistyped email address.

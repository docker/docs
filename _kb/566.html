 <p>
  Docker Cloud creates a project named “Docker Cloud” which contains all the devices that Docker Cloud deploys, no matter what type of device you chose.
 </p>
 <p>
  Device storage is organized the following way:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Type 1 devices have a RAID 1 of two SSD drives mounted in “/”
  </li>
  <li>
   Type 3 devices also have a RAID 1 of two SSD drives mounted in “/”, and also offers two NVMe drives without being mounted. Docker Cloud mounts a RAID 1 in “/var/lib/docker”.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  An SSH keypair named
  <code>
   dockercloud-&lt;uuid&gt;
  </code>
  is created if no key is found in your account.
 </p>

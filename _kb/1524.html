  Viewing Cases and Entitlements
 </h2>
 <p>
  After successful login, you will see all open cases you've created so far (if any). If you don't see any cases and you know you've created them, or you just want to refresh the list, you can hit the "recycle/refresh" button (next to the "New Case" button) to refresh the case list.
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" class="internal default" src="/_kb/images/1524-1.png"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  There are two views available from this page:
  <strong>
   Cases
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Entitlements
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  By default, you will see the
  <strong>
   Cases
  </strong>
  view. From the pull-down menu above the list of cases, you have the following sort options:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    All Cases
   </strong>
   — All cases for you or your organization (if this latter feature has been enabled for your team). This includes closed cases.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    All Open Cases
   </strong>
   — All open cases for your or your organization
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    My Cases
   </strong>
   — All cases owned by you
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Recently Viewed Cases
   </strong>
   — Cased you have recently viewed
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Click the
  <strong>
   Entitlements
  </strong>
  tab at the top of the page to view a list of active support entitlements for your organization.
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" class="internal default" src="/_kb/images/1524-2.png"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  Click on the
  <strong>
   Entitlement Name
  </strong>
  to view details for the entitlement, including cases associated with the entitlement.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  Some entitlement names include a node count such as
  <strong>
   Docker Datacenter with Business Critical Support - 1 Node (1 year subscription)
  </strong>
  . These entitlement names indicate how many nodes are supported with each entitlement — they do not represent the number of those entitlements associated with your account. The
  <strong>
   Entitlements
  </strong>
  tab lists each type of entitlement associated with your account, but not the number of each type of entitlement.

  Opening a Support Case
 </h2>
 <p>
  You must be logged in to open a support ticket. On the
  <strong>
   Cases
  </strong>
  tab, click the
  <strong>
   New Case
  </strong>
  button. The following will appear:
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" class="internal default" src="/_kb/images/1524-3.png"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  By default, you are set as the
  <strong>
   Contact Name
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  For the
  <strong>
   Entitlement Name
  </strong>
  , click the search button next to the entry field and select one of your available support entitlements. Only active entitlements are shown.
 </p>
 <p>
  Provide the following for each new case:
 </p>

  <p>
   Lastly, include a subject and description. The subject should summarize the case, and the description should give details.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    As you type the subject, similar issues that have already been solved and documented in the
    <a href="https://success.docker.com/KBase" rel="internal" title="KBase">
     Docker Knowledgebase
    </a>
    are shown. These recommendations may offer a quick resolution to your issue. If you see a KBase recommendation that applies to your issue, click on it to review the article.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <div class="mt-include" id="s640">
   <p>
    <span>
     To assist you better, it is recommended that you provide a short summary of your Docker use case as well as a detailed description of the issue you are facing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    Additionally, it helps speed the troubleshooting process when information about your Docker configuration and host environment is provided. For Docker EE, this can be done by using a UCP support dump, which is an archive that contains UCP system logs and diagnostic information. To obtain a support dump:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     Log into the UCP UI with an administrator account.
    </li>
    <li>
     On the top-right menu, click your username, and choose
     <strong>
      Support Dump
     </strong>
     . An archive will be downloaded via your browser after a brief time interval.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    If the user interface is not accessible, you may perform the following steps instead to obtain a single-node version of the UCP support dump:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     Obtain direct CLI access to the Docker daemon on a UCP manager node.
    </li>
    <li>
     Run the CLI support tool with the following command:
     <pre>
docker run --rm \
  --name ucp \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  docker/ucp:<span class="replaceabletext">2.1.4</span> \
  support &gt; docker-support-$HOSTNAME.tgz</pre>
    </li>
   </ol>

  <span id="Attachment_(Optional)">
  </span>
  <h6 id="5-3">

  </h6>
  <p>
   When creating a ticket, you can attachment a file to it when submitting it. To do so, click
   <strong>
    Submit &amp; Add Attachment
   </strong>
   . You will be prompted to select a file to upload. You will be able to add attachments later as well.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   After providing the information needed for a new case, be sure to

   the case so that it is assigned a case number and Docker Technical Support staff are notified.

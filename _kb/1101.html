<p>
 After removing a node from Docker Cloud using the Docker Cloud CLI tool (
 <code>
  docker-cloud node rm
  <span class="replaceabletext">
   &lt;node-UUID&gt;
  </span>
 </code>
 ), you might see the following error when trying to add the node back:
</p>
<pre>
ERROR: Docker Cloud Agent is already installed in this host
If the node failed to register properly with Docker Cloud, try to restart the agent by executing:
service dockercloud-agent restart
and check the logs at /var/log/dockercloud/agent.log for possible errors. 
If the problem persists, please contact us at support@docker.com 
</pre>
<p>
 There error might occur for 2 reasons:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  Configuration file from the previous agent installation is affecting the new installation.
 </li>
 <li>
  You are trying to add a node, but you have zero node allocations left.
 </li>
</ol>

 <p>
  If this issue is because the configuration file from the previous agent installation is affecting the new installation, assuming that your host is running
  <strong>
   Ubuntu/Debian
  </strong>
  , you can run the following commands to fix the issue:
 </p>
 <pre>
sudo apt-get remove dockercloud-agent
sudo apt-get purge dockercloud-agent
</pre>
 <p>
  The first command uninstalls the agent, and the second command removes all remaining configuration files from the previous installation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once done, try creating the node again by running the command given by Cloud when you click the
  <strong>
   Bring your own node
  </strong>
  button. The command looks something similar to this:
 </p>
 <pre>
curl -Ls https://get.cloud.docker.com/ | sudo -H sh -s 487aa1350fc242eda12ccdcad2818935
</pre>
 <p>
  If you are attempting to add a node to Docker Cloud without node allocations, you can add nodes by going to your Account Settings:
  <a class="link-https" href="https://cloud.docker.com/account/#plan" rel="freeklink" title="https://cloud.docker.com/account/#plan">
   https://cloud.docker.com/account/#plan
  </a>

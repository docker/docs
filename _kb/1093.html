<p>
 To determine whether or not your DTR is correctly integrated with your UCP, first make sure you have followed the steps in
 <a class="link-https" href="https://docs.docker.com/ucp/dtr-integration/" rel="freeklink" title="https://docs.docker.com/ucp/dtr-integration/">
  https://docs.docker.com/ucp/dtr-integration/
 </a>
 to integrate UCP with your DTR instance. This document also includes the steps to verify the integration.
</p>
<p>
 The following steps will further help you ensure the integration. They will show you how to push an image to your DTR and then pull that image from UCP
</p>
<p>
 NOTE: Replace
 <code>
  <span class="replaceabletext">
   &lt;your-dtr-instance&gt;
  </span>
 </code>
 with the domain name for your DTR such as
 <code>
  <span class="replaceabletext">
   dtr.example.net
  </span>
 </code>
 for you. Also make sure that this domain name can be reached from your UCP server before continuing.
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  From any machine, log into your DTR, pull an image ( such as `
  <strong>
   busybox
  </strong>
  `, from Docker Hub ), and then push it to DTR:
  <pre>
docker login
docker pull busybox
docker tag busybox <span class="replaceabletext">&lt;your-dtr-instance&gt;</span>/admin/mybusybox
docker login <span class="replaceabletext">&lt;your-dtr-instance&gt;</span>
</pre>
 </li>
 <li>
  From your UCP, create a repository named
  <code>
   admin/mybusybox
  </code>
  .
 </li>
 <li>
  Push the image to your DTR:
  <pre>
docker push <span class="replaceabletext">&lt;your-dtr-instance&gt;</span>/admin/mybusybox
</pre>
 </li>
 <li>
  Go to the
  <strong>
   Containers
  </strong>
  page in your UCP, and click on
  <strong>
   +Deploy Container
  </strong>
  .
 </li>
 <li>
  Deploy your container with the image you pushed, and click on
  <strong>
   Run Container
  </strong>
  .
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 If the deployment is successful, that means your UCP was able to pull images from your DTR without any problem.

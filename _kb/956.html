  Question
 </h1>
 <p>
  I just purchased a subscription plan with my personal account but I meant to add it to my organization account. Is there any way to migrate that subscription to the organization without having to repeat the purchase?

 <p>
  Due to our privacy policies and for your protection, Docker Support is not allowed to make any billing adjustments for our customers. If you cancel an existing subscription the billing system automatically prorates and refunds any charges. You can then re-subscribe with the other user or organization account.

 <strong>
  The ucp-auth-worker-data volume can store a huge amount of logging data
 </strong>
 . By default, up to 500 job logs are stored, and log severity is set to "Info" by default. The logs can become an issue with storage if a "Debug" severity level is used, or if there is already insufficient storage space available for Docker volumes prior to installing UCP.
</p>
<p>
 The following method can be used to resolve issues with insufficient space for the ucp-auth-worker-data volume:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  Stop the ucp-auth-worker container.
 </li>
 <li>
  Remove the logs in
  <code>
   /var/lib/docker/volumes/ucp-au&lt;wbr/&gt;th-worker-data/_data/jobs
  </code>
  (but do not attempt to remove the ucp-auth-worker-data volume).
 </li>
 <li>
  Restart the ucp-auth-worker container.
 </li>
 <li>
  Modify the severity level to be less aggressive in logging via the UCP dashboard (
  <strong>
   Admin Settings
  </strong>
  &gt;
  <strong>
   Logs
  </strong>
  &gt;
  <strong>
   Log Severity Level
  </strong>
  ) or set up a remote log server as described in the
  <a class="link-https" href="https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.0/guides/configuration/configure-logs/" rel="freeklink" title="https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.0/guides/configuration/configure-logs/">
   documentation

  .
 </li>
</ol>

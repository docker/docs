<p>
 Invoices can only be sent to one email address. If you would like invoices sent to more than one person, ask your system administrator to create an email group within your organization that includes everyone who needs invoices. Ex.
 <a class="link-mailto" href="mailto:Billing@yourcompany.com" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="mailto:Billing@yourcompany.com">
  Billing@yourcompany.com
 </a>
</p>

{% endraw %}

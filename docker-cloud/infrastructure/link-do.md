title: Link a DigitalOcean account
---

You can link your DigitalOcean account to your Docker Cloud account to deploy **nodes** and **node clusters** using Docker Cloud's Dashboard, API, and CLI.  You must link your DigitalOcean account so that Docker Cloud can interact with DigitalOcean on your behalf to create and manage your **nodes** (droplets).

If you don't have a **DigitalOcean** account, you can sign up with this link to get a $10 credit: [https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=bc0c34035aa5](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=bc0c34035aa5)

## Link your DigitalOcean Account

To link your DigitalOcean account so you can launch **nodes** using Docker Cloud,
navigate to **Account info \> Cloud Providers**. You'll see a list of all the providers that you can link to Docker Cloud. Click **Link account** next to DigitalOcean.
